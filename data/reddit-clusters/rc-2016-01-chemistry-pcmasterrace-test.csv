"It is one of the few vegetable oils with a high enough melting point to be solid at room temperature. Cocoa butter is another vegetable oil with similar properties. So palm oil is often used as a bulking agent in to make a larger volume of chocolate from cocoa butter.

Saturated vegetable fats with high melting points also have higher thermal stability than unsaturated oils. So they last longer when used for high temperature cooking - deep frying, for example. Coconut oil would also be good for this, but palm oil is a lot cheaper.

The other major use of palm oil is for making biodiesel. But while this generates a great deal of cash, it doesn't make any environmental sense. Palm oil only grows efficiently in tropical regions, so huge amounts of rainforest are cut down to make way for plantations. The forests are often burned as a result. Also, the waste plant material is usually burned after the palm oil has been extracted. So while the resulting biodiesel may be ""carbon-neutral"" where it is used (most is exported), if you take the production into account, biodiesel from palm oil actually does more environmental damage (in terms of carbon dioxide emissions alone) than diesel from petroleum sources.",chemistry,1,1200.0

It might be a problem your way if you are ending up pipetting very small volumes. I usually try to avoid pipetting anything less than around 10 uL when doing something analytical as it helps to reduce error.

"Even though I agree that a more intelligent society might be a better place to live, I doubt that it can be approached from that angle. People have to want to do things, and the process of making them want that is the cultural war I was speaking about. 

Anything is provable with the right set of assumptions. It usually does no good to discuss these topics with people because they will go round and round without ever getting down to the core of their beliefs. Part of your core is that we should all work together by eliminating several industries; this is an action of dominance. Your previous statement that was negative towards capitalism was an action of dominance too. To be clear, if you are to claim any moral justification for your beliefs, you have to admit that you do not care what others think and simply want to assert your dominance. This is to contrast with an opinion that would be to simply apply balance/equality to a culture war, helping the weak and hurting the strong; you are not taking that stance. I want to emphasize this because often I see people taking dominant stances while thinking and posturing with submissive stances (see: militant liberalism).

If you want to be pragmatic about it, not concerning yourself with whether or not you're wrong/right morally, then you could develop an argument based upon optimizing various metrics (economics, measures of health, measures of technological capability, etc) and why those metrics are more important than others.

"Rotavap pumps are not very strong; if your compound has some sort of strong interaction with the molecule of interest they will not evaporate as readily. Before increasing temperature (which as a general rule can sometimes lead to decomposition) try using lower pressures, i.e. A stronger vacuum. This is why people suggest using a high vac from a schlenk line--get rid of the strongly solvated solvent and it should crystallize spontaneously. Happens all the time. :)

Another trick I like is to add a relatively low boiling solvent like pentane or ether and evaporate that off; each time you do this, you break up those solvent/product interactions with the solvent and then azeotrope off the impurity. Repeating this a few times sometimes leads to nice powders, but high vac should still be your ultimate solution",chemistry,1,1200.0

"So long as I keep things below 270 degrees, HF *will not* form. I’m trying to build a system that will completely kill the process at approximately 270 degrees (which is 10 degrees outside the desired process constraints anyway), but, if by some fluke of design failure or system misuse, it reaches 290 degrees C anyway, it will fail safe, disastrous chemicals will stay contained, and suitable warnings will be given, so the required precautions (evacuation, venting) can be taken. HF in the system is a *completely* undesirable condition that provides no benefit, and a *whole lot* of unnecessary hazard, and is to be avoided at all costs. I intend to design to the constraints of keeping the temperatures below the HF limits, and then design and build around that under the constraints that I can stop the process at the first detection of *any* HF *anywhere*, and keep the results contained. Appropriate sensors for detecting HF would be appreciated.

Thinner bore tubing is *not* going to be a factor. The only “tubing” I was considering besides the main vessel and any venting was possibly a double-boiling the Galden with [high temperature grade mineral oil](https://www.therminol.com/products/Therminol-XP) for a while. But, while that would certainly prevent direct exposure of heating elements to gaseous Galden instead of the liquid Galden the PID controller expects, which would cause the gas to rapidly heat beyond the intended temperatures, it would also introduce some “thermal inertia” into the system that may badly interfere with having suitable process control. Also, the flash point is an additional issue, though not insurmountable, and certainly a less disastrous scenario than HF.

Obviously, the choice of heating element is very important here... I need a ramp rate of 3 degrees Celsius per second from room temperature until 260 degrees Celsius, low thermal inertia to prevent overshoot (although good controllers can account for some of that), and it shouldn’t introduce any significant RF or EM fields to the boards. A hot plate with a suitable heatsink and a thermocouple *may* be sufficient, but I’m open to better ideas.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"To get any reasonable rate of reaction with electrolysis, you need a high current power source. So most batteries won't last for long, with one exception - large lead-acid batteries, the type used in cars or trucks. If you have to use a battery, that would be the type to go for.

Of course, any battery will eventually need to be recharged. A car battery charger will typically supply at least 5 amps at 12 volts, which makes it a good electrolysis power supply. You could also salvage an old computer power supply and use the 12 volt rail from that. Most of them have multiple 12 volt rails, so you could run more than one electrolysis experiment at the same time with that.

Or you could build your own. Electrolysis doesn't need a precisely voltage-regulated supply, so it can be very simple. A transformer rated for at least 200 VA with a 12 volt secondary winding, a box to mount it in, plus a bridge rectifier and an on-off switch is all you really need. Mains supply ---&gt; switch ---&gt; transformer primary winding. Then transformer secondary winding ---&gt; bridge rectifier = 12 volt DC output supply at 200 Watts, giving about 8 amps.

"People make bigger screw-ups all the time. But that's not why I'm commenting here. I'm commenting because there's something to be said about somebody who does the same thing over and over and expects a different result. If you did this procedure once and got anomalous results, fine. If you did this many times and still get the same anomalous results, then you've made a discovery. That or you have some sort of systematic error in your instrumentation, which you should fix before doing the experiment again and expecting a different result. 

This is what the PI would expect from you. If you go into a lab meeting saying you did this experiment ten times and got the same results that don't make sense, he/she is going to tell you to go and interpret/analyze the results before doing any more experiments. Science isn't about blindly doing something until you get the result you want. 

With that said, screw-ups with interns are to be expected since you're still training, within reason of course. So if you screw up a few times, it doesn't reflect poorly on you.

"The main two chemicals that will make this project work is starch and water. The plant source or technology used behind extracting the starch is for the most part irrelevant to my research, but I chose to use tapioca starch. When a suspension of starch and water is heated, it increases the amount of interaction between the starch molecules and water; thickening the liquid the exact same way you'd thicken fat or stock into gravy. This process is pmuch called starch gelatinization, and this also encourages starch plasticization which we can do with glycerol. Although I use glycerl as my plasticizer, although this chemical in specific doesn't necessarily have to be used. Vinegar is used in my case simply because it is very easily accessible, but the whole purpose of it is to mix a small amount of acid that will be used to start a hydrolysis reaction between the water and polymer chains. I heat it using any standard gas stove flame for a consistent four minutes. At this point the substance should be very viscous and somewhat translucent. It should be a very sticky substance at this point, and I pour whatever amount needed into a small well, rectangular plate, or mold(like I'm asking for atm). I now leave my trays in my house at regular room temperatures (nothing special to accelerate this process) and wait for them to dry.

"Like others have said, I would definitely get a general chemistry text book.  Obviously the textbook will have tons of useful information, but I think the most important thing about getting a text book is that it lets you know where to start and gives you the framework and order of topics that will be most effective for learning.

For example, if you try to teach yourself about chemical bonding before you teach yourself about ions and the basics of electron configuration, it might be frustrating and a less effective way of learning the subject.  But, I bet any general chem textbook you pick up is going to have the chapters on ions and electron config before the chemical bonding chapters.

Once you have your framework (think of it as a syllabus) then your options for learning it are unlimited.  There are tons of channels on YouTube that teach the concepts, lectures available online, google, etc..

"Alkylsulfonic acids - R-SO*_3_*H - are broadly similar, having an alkyl group in place of the amino group of sulfamic acid. Though without the amino group to form a zwitterion, alkylsulfonic acids can be significantly stronger.

Also, depending on the length of the alkyl chain, alkylsulfonic acids can behave as detergents. In fact, numerous variations on benzenesulfonic acid with long alkyl groups hanging off the benzene ring are commonly used (as their sodium salts) in heavy duty detergent cleaning products.

Small molecule versions such as methanesulfonic acid are liquids, but larger versions such as benzenesulfonic acid are solids, though the melting points are somewhat lower than that of sulfamic acid. If melting point is critical, choose an appropriate sized molecule to suit your requirements.

"This isn't a defense of chemophobia, but is possibly a worthwhile defense of ""natural"" fads: when science and capitalism work together, the inevitable result is always going to be to look for and produce the most potent (and therefore cost effective) possible product. Obviously much of our pharmacopeia is derivative of natural compounds, and often can produce more powerful beneficial effects alongside fewer off-target effects. But there's a difference between a cup of tea and caffeine pill. Yes, that difference is quantifiable, and there's now extensive scientific literature on catechins and theanine and other chemicals which make up the tea leaf...


And yet, to perseverate on this example for a moment, we don't put these things in caffeine pills. We don't put them in energy drinks. The energy drinks which do contain other ""healthy"" plant extracts like ginseng or ginkgo or ashwaganda only ever add them in insignificant, pharmacologically irrelevant quantities. 

Similarly, we can put 400 IU (or even 5000 or 10,000 IU) vitamin D in a gelcap and sell it over the counter, but it doesn't substitute for sunlight. We can take hundreds of milligrams of magnesium and zinc and other nutrients and hardly utilize any of it, since it's typically sold in a non-chelated form. Sure, good chemistry knowledge can explain why a large quantity of a nutrient in a poorly bioavailable form isn't effective, and the people with the right kind of knowledge can use it to benefit themselves in their decisionmaking, but it doesn't change the fact that a ""natural"" source of that nutrient (i.e. Real food) will provide more beneficial effects. And 50 years ago, we would have had more difficulty explaining why a magnesium oxide pill was a less effective supplement than a magnesium taurate pill (or just a banana). 

But now the other side:

Coconut oil is the new fad. Everyone wants in on it. It's good as a moisturizer, it's healthy to eat, hell I hear people talking about how great it is as lube. Of course... We know that of the different constituent oils of a coconut, only some are good for you, while others are neutral or even proinflammatory. A full spectrum coconut extract might have ""X"" health benefit or nutritive value. An artificial synthesis of the specific beneficial medium chain fatty acids (the shorter ones--the longer ones behave metabolically like long chain fatty acids) might have the same benefit, or even a greater benefit. But almost every product out there marketing themselves as including coconut oil or coconut extract won't be including these in significant quantities, because the less useful fraction can be acquired cheap in bulk and can be marketed the same way.

The main message is: buyer beware. Don't drink the metaphorical cool aid about any product--or at least about any product you actually care about: always do your own research.
""Natural"" isn't--or shouldn't be--an end unto itself. But it's a good ""safe"" strategy to play to maximize benefit with minimal knowledge--our society's mass consumption model means that simplification and concentration of an effect are always going to take priority in the marketplace--and if there's something lost in the process, only those who are sufficiently educated in the topic will be able to identify what that is (ie. Buying chelated supplements rather than the cheap stuff... If they actually have a nutritional deficiency in need of supplementation in the first place).   This makes the ""natural"" fad a potentially viable option for the uninformed consumer who isn't realistically going to study up on the differences in metabolic fate and pharmacological activity of capryllic acid and capric acid that make them especially valuable products of coconut oil fractionation. On the other hand, it can also trap them: the unwary consumer who knows only that the coconut is in vogue will be the first to buy the lauric-acid containing ""coconut oil"" products which might still make a good moisturizer but have none of the benefits that a full spectrum extract or an artificial product which includes those other oils. 

We should oppose chemophobia wherever we can, but this doesn't mean castigating ""natural"" products. If anything, it should mean the opposite--a call for tighter regulation on what can and can't be defined as ""natural"" or ""organic"". We""re still learning every day about the interactions of between our body and our environment--and it can feel like a rollercoaster to the uneducated: ""first, it's fat is bad, then its fat is good, but only some fat! Unsaturated fats are good! Wait no, monounsaturated fats are bad. But polyunsaturated fats are good! Actually wait no it's n6 polyunsaturated fats that are good and the rest are inert. Wait no some n6 fats promote inflammation. Don't eat saturated fats! Wait, saturated fats might not be bad, never mind. Actually saturated fats are good! Errr... Only some are....""

 And on and on. Fats are calorie dense. Saturated fats raise testosterone. Saturated fats also increase LDL *but they increase HDL by an equal margin, and they increase a kind of LDL that isn't associated with cardiovascular risk.* But some saturated fats promote inflammatory responses. As each new piece of knowledge about a topic comes out--and as the real scientists are carefully, slowly, evolving their understanding of a complicated health topic... All the public sees is an absurd pendulum swinging back and forth between ""good"" and ""bad"". It's understandable... Maybe even *commendable*, to retreat to ""what's tried and true"" in the face of uncertainty--just so long as this choice is seen for what it is. And just so long as these ""natural"" products stay natural. ",chemistry,9,1200.0

It has this in case the vacuum insulation layer leaks - if that happens, air gets in, the insulation layer is no longer insulating and the liquid nitrogen begins to boil rapidly. Without a burst disk to stop the pressure buildup, the entire tank would explode.

However, tanks for containing toxic gases are specially built to withstand a great deal more pressure, since by law they aren't allowed to have burst disks. Chlorine is a bit different to nitrogen, since it can be liquefied under pressure, which cannot be done to nitrogen.

"Freezing point depression is a colligative property - it doesn't quite matter (typically) what it is, but how many molecules you have dissolved to disrupt the ice-lattice.

Equation:

ΔTF = KF · b · i, where KF is a constant that's solvent dependent (in this case, water), b is the concentration of what is dissolved in the solvent, and i is the number of ions per molecule of what's being dissolved. 

So, a larger change in the freezing point is directly proportional to how many ions are formed per molecule. Salts tend to have a very high solubility in water, so that's helpful. For instance, for NaCl, i = 2. For MgCl2 and CaCl2, i = 3, so they'll be generally more effective in de-icing (and are already available as de-icers). 

There are other factors to go into a de-icer choice, but in terms of safety, calcium magnesium acetate is about as good as rock salt, but safer for vegetation etc. I can't comment on availability or price, this is just from googling.",chemistry,5,1200.0

"While I agree with most of what you said, I disagree about memorizing. I would say that as synthetic chemists, we don't memorize mechanisms but we learn electric pushing to understand how different functional groups react with each other. It would be a misapplication to say that as chemists we memorize these mechanisms and retain them, we learn the principles of electron pushing so we don't have to memorize mechanism after mechanism. We do, however memorize named reactions to know what the substrates and products are. 

An example, do I have the mechanisms for an Ugi reaction or the Mitsunobu reaction memorized? No. But can I correctly illustrate them. Probably/yes. This is because I learned electron pushing. In terms of memorizing, I do remember what the product should be from either of those reactions, so I memorized the product, but not the mechanism. It's a subtle but very important difference. 

That because said, even without memorization, using just the reagents and reactants, and understanding electron pushing, most synthetic chemists and roughly show you what the product SHOULD be (assuming something odd doesn't occur). ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"If you can process your growth medium so that it's completely transparent, you can acidify and add a solution of barium chloride. This precipitates with both sulfate and carbonate, but an acid medium will decompose the carbonate. Under these conditions, the barium sulfate precipitate may form a white turbidity that will the stable enough to measure the optical density (actually light scattering). 

Because of the many issues with crystal size, etc, in light scattering, it's a good idea to use an internal standard with each sample. That just means adding an appropriate amount of sulfate to an already-measured sample and noting the increase in turbidity.

"A couple of students went to Belgium during my year out. Generally, all their accommodation was provided by (paid for) the company (at a nearby university-type setup, I think). They were paid a living allowance, reduced as no accommodation was needed. In this case I think they were paid through our university who were then paid by the company but that may just be a quirk of that set up. 

The easiest way to find out the most specific information: just ask the company. If they've sent the advertisement overseas there's a very good chance they've done it before and have something in place they can tell you about. Ask how many students they take - good chance if they take more than one that you'll all end up spending social time together, for instance.

You can probably also do it in a similar manner using the fid (highest point divided by the width of the signal at the end of the fid). You should see that the S/N is a function of e^-at.

"Ammonia itself is an amazing cleaner.  Most people don't use it because of the smell.  Ammonia and vinegar are very inexpensive and effective.

Ammonia has a low surface tension.  And will saponify fats to make them water soluble.

Acetic acid works well at removing metal deposits like calcium and magnesium.  Calcium and magnesium are common in tap water.  The acetic acid will act as a chelating agent preventing these metals from depositing on the surface (limescale/soap scum).

You can also add small amounts of isopropyl alcohol to lower the surface tension further.  This will help prevent streaking.

I don't use sudsy ammonia and I don't add surfactants.  They only tend to leave a residue behind.

"All that has happened is the magnesium bicarbonate has neutralized some of the acids (citric acid and ascorbic acid) from the lemon. Depending on how much lemon juice you added, you may have some acid left over or some magnesium bicarbonate left over - it is unlikely that you have added precisely enough to do a perfect neutralization, but that doesn't matter.

You can tell which was in excess by the taste. If it still tastes sour (like lemon juice, but probably less intense) then you still have some acids remaining. But if all the sourness has gone and the taste is more like that of fizzy water, then all the acids have been neutralized and you have some bicarbonate left over.

Either way, the products are going to be magnesium citrate and magnesium ascorbate - the magnesium salts of citric and ascorbic acids. These are still soluble and completely safe to drink - you will still absorb the magnesium content of the water when you drink it. The fizzing is the release of carbon dioxide gas from decomposition of the bicarbonate.

What has happened is similar to what would happen in your stomach if you drank some magnesium bicarbonate solution. Stomach acid contains dilute hydrochloric acid - this would react with magnesium bicarbonate in a similar neutralization reaction. The products of that would be magnesium chloride and again, carbon dioxide gas. Which is why you can burp or belch after taking antacids containing either carbonate or bicarbonate salts.",chemistry,17,1200.0

"So look, I exclusively used a TitanFall XBONE controller for a while with the wireless adapter. Some terrible drift on the left stick has manifested so I bought a Steam Controller for 40USD from a fellow redditor. It's on the way to my place right now so I can't give you a definitive review.

From all of the research I've done, the controller has a fairly steep learning curve - especially if you're used to the ""standard"" dual joystick controller. However, it is way more versatile for use in way more games. Check out Woodsie's videos on YouTube for some of the use cases. You'll have to add the Origin/UPlay games to Steam in order to use the Steam Controller. Also you can only configure the SC in Big Picture mode. This is annoying. Check out the /r/SteamController subreddit for more details.

I noticed you mentioned using the PS3 controller. I'm actually trying that right now. It's waay more of a pain in the ass than using the XBONE controller, which is plug and play using MicroUSB or the 25 dollar wireless adapter.

"It is more of a physical difference than a chemical one. A 1.5 volt alkaline cell ""battery"" is more accurately called a cell, because it contains only one cathode and one anode in a single container. This is true no matter what the size, even up to the fat D-size.

Alkaline batteries of more than 1.5 volts are always multiples of 1.5, so commonly 4.5, 6 or 9 volts. These contain 3, 4 or 6 alkaline cells, so are true batteries. There are two common physical sizes of 9 volt battery, the small PP9 size (as used in smoke alarms) or the significantly larger PP7 size.

The PP7 contains 6 AA cells arranged in series, inside a metal, plastic or cardboard case. The smaller PP9 contains 6 AAAA cells in the same arrangement.

I'm sure you can get a job without one somewhere else, but from my standpoint, we won't look at you without a post doc. The job market has saturated well qualified people that caused this to happen. The associates level is worse. I think you made a great choice doing a half org half inorg. You would have no problem fitting in government or in industry, it all depends on what you want. 
If inorganic, then Haliburton or BP or government positions would love you, but fossil fuels have been going on a nose dive in the market, so I'm not sure of they will hire or if you keep your job within five years. Usually fragrances would prefer formulation chemists, which, personally, it has to be your bag. I'm saying this, because the science is just mix this and that, in a certain concentration, no named reactions involved (as in a Wittig or Sandmeyer, etc) and no catalysis. I've known a colleague to go into formulations as a PhD, no post-doc, and he hates it as he was doing total synthesis in grad school. But some people love it! I've also known a guy that did inorg and worked at a government lab and now is in Germany researching on Boron chemistry. I think you are making an excellent decision in expanding your horizons and not pigeon-holing yourself in a specific area chemistry. Merck loves post doc positions for catalysis as well as Pfizer, so it may help you in deciding if industry is good for you if you decide to do a post-doc.  If not, National Labs would love you.

"Lol. To put it in simple terms for someone who doesn't study chemistry. The picture shows 3 different line structure models. They are a simple way for chemists to show molecules to each other. If you were taking a beginning chemistry course you would see it drawn as;

 C - C+ = C for A, C - C+ - C for B, 


you would not be able to simply show the third one except as a triangle with C's on each corner and 3 lines connecting the bottom 2. Each one contains 3 Carbon atoms (and also 5, 7, and 1 Hydrogen respectively but they are not shown)

most molecules do not like having +'s (or -'s for that matter) because it symbolizes that they are charged. With this in mind you may think that the bottom molecule is best because it doesn't have a positive charge. However, it has several other problems that make it a really bad molecule that would immediately fall apart. The most important is that if two Carbons are connected by three lines (meaning they are triple bonded or have three bonds connecting them) They prefer to be in a strait line with the next carbon. both carbons are bent 60 degrees when they would prefer to be 180 degrees or linear.

There are other reasons this molecule would not be stable but for now I hope that explaination helps.",chemistry,2,1200.0

Also, a lot of the shapes you encounter will be very intuitive. Without any knowledge of VSEPR theory, you likely already know that O=C=O is linear just by looking at it. The same goes for tetrahedral structures (picture CH4 with all bonds equally spaced). Now just remember that lone pairs of electrons repel bonding electrons but don't extend outward, and you should see how a molecule with two bonding pairs and two lone pairs becomes bent (H-O-H), and how three bonding pairs and one lone pair becomes trigonal pyramidal (NH3).

"Argh, typical analytical paper - excruciating details about things that don't matter and too little detail about the conditions of the supposed reaction. :p

The degree of reaction is directly related to the boiling point of the amine. My hypothesis is that the bigger amines experience a longer reaction time in the condensed phase in the injection port before they vaporize, with the heaviest ones taking the longest to boil and therefore getting the longest reaction times.

They say that they controlled for this, but if you read their short experimental details you see that they did a spot on TLC and put it in an iodine chamber, and observed two spots. Not real quantitative. Probably a little bit of the imine forms at RT and then more gets formed when you fire it into the injection port.

"Mmm, very interesting idea of using peltier tiles as a renewable energy source. Definitely not something new or innovative as of recently, but it's always great to see new scientists entering the field of renewable energy sources. Peltier plates are a great start for looking into new ways to replace old conventional sources of energy. However, the bottleneck in your research is not necessarily in anything you're doing wrong. Peltier tiles can only become so efficient until the only bottleneck in your process is the amount of thermal heat itself. Only so much energy out of the small amount of infrared radiation being emitted from our bodies can be transformed into electrical energy. My suggestion, to demonstrate the true power of peltier tiles on a much more macroscopic scale (where harnessing power for uses aside from personal items such as flashlights), you should heat it up to a specific temperature. Perhaps use a heat gun or even a simple hair dryer. Ironic and completely pointless, but for demonstrative purposes you could possibly show that by implementing this technology into something, such as all of the lightbulbs in your homes (that release too much infrared radiation instead of radiation in the visible spectrum), could harness a lot of energy. This technology can be implemented into so many different electronics that emit heat,  as a means of reducing the total wattage that the electronic will pull from the wall. Putting them in cpu heatsinks is a good idea to start, as they usually go to around 60 to 80 degrees celsius under full load. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"This has been a known issue since July 2014.

See the article here: http://vrworld.com/2014/07/31/nvidia-disables-gpu-physx-2nd-non-nv-gpu-installed/

The two main questions OP has been asking were:
Why is it being disabled?
&gt;According to Nvidia, GPU PhysX is disabled when a non-Nvidia GPU is present because the company says a high quality experience in such a scenario can’t be guaranteed. Such a combination would preclude users from utilizing using key features such as high performance communication between CUDA and the graphics API. Unfortunately for many users Nvidia says it has not found a full-proof way to detect whether or not the non-Nvidia GPU is truly idle throughout the application’s lifetime, so CPU PhysX is used instead ensuring a quality experience for all

And why does it work with Intel Onboard?
&gt;This issue should not arise in systems that have Intel GPUs that switch between onboard and dedicated (Nvidia) because of Nvidia’s Optimus technology.

Why can't Nvidia work with AMD to be able to reliably detect whether or not an AMD GPU is idle?  Nobody knows, but you should probably be yelling at AMD.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"You can consider electron orbitals both ways at the same time, believe it or not. You're quite right that the Schrodinger wavefunction for a given orbital does mathematically describe where the electrons are most likely to be found. But that same wavefunction also describes the shape and size of the electron orbitals.

The electrons within any given orbital are constantly moving, so do have a velocity at any given moment in time. Of course, you can only know the average of where any particular electron is, as determined by the probability map of the orbital it is in.

But for a simple spherical s-orbital, you can use that to determine the mean orbital radius - the average distance the electron is from the nucleus. You know the charge on the electron, you also know the charge on the nucleus, so you can therefore calculate the velocity the electron must have to maintain a stable orbit.

It turns out that for electrons in the 1s-orbital of a gold or mercury atom, that velocity is approximately 50% of light speed. The relativistic effect of that velocity causes the electrons in that orbital to increase in mass, which causes the mean orbital radius to shrink.

The same is true for all the inner orbitals of similarly heavy elements, though the proportion the orbitals shrink by decreases as the mean distance from the nucleus increases. The upshot is some strange effects, such as the colours of gold, silver and caesium, or the low melting point of mercury.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"I have a BS in ChE and am on my 4th year of my PhD in MSE, however the nature of my dissertation work has me doing a lot of synthesis (I make/modify conjugated polymers for organic solar cells).  I also work in a lab based in the chemistry department so I have heard a lot about my lab mates' experiences.  I think the biggest misconception about ChE from chemists is how little your chemistry training will help.  In ChE we just used letters is 90% of our courses A+B-&gt;C, that type of stuff. After all, you chemists have figured out the chemistry and we know just enough to follow it.

As others have pointed out, ChE is much more about the math and niche physics topics that allow you to scale bench reactions to industrial processes more used in industry. You'd have to take a thermo sequence as well as heat, mass, and momentum transfer courses before you can get into the courses that make you a ChE (IMO) like reactor design (kinetics) or process design etc. If you have an ACS chemistry degree, I don't think the math would be too overwhelming (based on my colleagues experiences); however you are basically starting at sophomore level ChE courses.

"I'll start by saying that I only use GC-MS or LC-MS for confirmation for molecules in organic synthesis, not testing of complex mixtures such as urine, especially for forensic uses or similar.

The GC part of GC-MS - the Gas Chromatograph - will vaporise the mixture and ionise it (make it charged +ve or -ve). The various molecules/metabolites (now charged) have different structures and therefore different molecular weights. Based on this, these charged molecules (ions) will travel at different rates, allowing them to be separated from one another.

The MS part of GC-MS - the Mass Spectrometer - analyses the ions by their molecular weight. They are incredibly powerful (they can detect as little as 0.00000000001g of material) and precise (displaying molecular weight to several decimal places). This allows the various molecules in the mixture to be identified - molecular weight at this level of precision is unique!

In terms of quantifying metabolites, the intensity of the peaks shown in a GC (corresponding to the time at which the molecule(s) passed the GC) is an indicator of the amount of each compound.

"This might help with your questions. It is one example of gamma radiation of a nuclear reaction that is able to break bonds.

&gt; Szilard Chalmers chemistry
In 1934 L. Szilard and T.A. Chalmers [1] discovered that chemical bond breaking could occur for atoms following nuclear reaction or radioactive decay even though the recoil energy in the initial process is not sufficient to overcome the chemical bonding energy. In the case of thermal neutron capture the processes involved in the emission of the g-ray , which removes the nuclear exitation energy, impart recoil energy to the atom to break most chemical bonds (n,g-recoil).

If it doesn't come clean with alconox/water followed by acetone rinse, it gets thrown out. Maybe (and that's a big maybe), if it's expensive, it'll get rinsed with dilute acid or base to try to dissolve any crusted on material, but even then I often would just rather buy a new one.",chemistry,5,1200.0

"If you don't mind melting your gold, you could separate the minerals from it with borax. To do this, you melt borax in a crucible and add the gold plus mineral mixture. The molten borax dissolves the minerals but not the gold, which effectively separates them away from it.

If the gold is in lots of small grains mixed intimately with mineral grains, then you would need to increase the temperature enough to melt the gold, which would sink to the bottom of the mixture as a nice round blob. As you let it cool down again, the blob of gold will solidify first, so you can then decant the molten borax-mineral solution off.

If your gold is one solid chunk or crystal, surrounded by minerals, then it is a bit easier. You then wouldn't have to heat the borax hot enough to melt the gold - about 800 ^o C would probably be enough. This would dissolve the minerals without melting the gold, so you could either extract the chunk of gold with tongs or decant the borax-mineral solution off.

To finish the purification, just rinse the cooled gold blob or chunk with hot water - this will dissolve away any residual borax which might be sticking to the surface. ",chemistry,3,1200.0

"High school (8 years ago) was the last time I was reading about it and I am not sure I am 100% right, but e.g. natural rubber will dissolve in stuff like gasoline because rubber is a polymer that is made from long polymer chains. But those chains are not chemically bonded together, that is why gasoline will dissolve the rubber completely to give you some sticky gloopy mess. That is how rubber glue is made.

If you vulcanise the rubber, sulfur atoms will hold the loong chains of rubber molecules not along the molecules like in natural rubber, but accross them. It will form a lattice of molecules and you will get vulcanised rubber. It doesn't dissolve in gasoline that easily. It will become jellylike and will become bigger but will retain the form of the piece of rubber. But it will be very easy to tear apart as opposed to original piece.

Now, I have no idea why epoxy will do that, but I think it has some additives to make it less brittle and they attack rubber molecule chains with the same result as above. Do you have a list of components used in the epoxy?

"I am having trouble believing you have all your details correct here, but you certainly know your FDG decay. My biggest complaint is your claim that gamma radiation is at the wrong frequency to interact with electron orbits - that's a load of crap (no offense). Gamma rays will happily interact with electrons, typically through Compton scattering. I am a bit curious why you put the minimum e+ decay energy at 5% of the speed of light? I've never bothered to look through the table, so that is believable, but it seems like odd information for someone to have collected. I think it is pretty likely not to be true though, as it is a three body decay and you should be able to distribute virtually zero energy in one of the decay products, so I am not so convinced there is a minimum.

"First, thank you for your reply.

Let me clarify - you were an undergraduate chemistry major as well? And you applied to graduate schools in math-centric fields, yes? I've been considering switching out of chemistry with a graduate degree but I don't know what programs I would be able to get into. The two areas I would like to get into are computer programming or engineering but I don't know if my background would get me into a graduate school in those areas. 

Additionally, I've spent a lot of time over the last 8 or so months developing a small business idea. I've just secured $3000 for my first product run. My hope is that I can eventually turn that business idea into a full time income - but until then I'm applying to chemistry jobs.

"I don't know the right answer but perhaps part of the effect might be that ice is less dense than water. I wonder what the molar heat capacity graph look like. Since the total degrees of freedom increases with temperature one would think that the heat capacity should only increase with increasing temperature. However, water has maximum density at about 4 c so that doesn't explain the entire dip. The graph should never be linear because there will be sharp changes at phase changes due to the sudden increase in degrees of freedom. We generally model CV with a virial expansion, but I really don't know why.",chemistry,1,1200.0

And if someone (presumably) thinks that the mouse is ruined because of a cut cable, telling that person to open the device and remove the connector or desolder the old wires from the PCB won't be a good suggestion as this makes the repair sound even more complicated and possibly introduces new issues (possibly different colors of the cables - which goes where?).
