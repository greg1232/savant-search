Wasn't aware you could ever run PhysX on an NVIDIA GPU and render the rest on an AMD. Granted I doubt either company goes out of its way to make this sort of thing possible. It's easy to imagine how it could get innocently broken. Other people in the thread are saying it is intentional but only because PhysX performance goes downhill in this scenario.

* Microphone is the best on a headset I've owned
* The microphone mute by pushing it up is a neat feature.

Couple of issues tho, the volume turner turns the volume from high, but it doesn't mute the sound, kind of weird.
You may need a sound card or a amp, just dependant on your preference.

It really is quite toxic to PC gaming, I hope AMD gets more popular as nvidia are certainly being abusive.

"Do you really think Nvidia chose whatever reason out of altruism? Companies only care about shareholders; that's just how it is. Consumers influence by dollar voting of course but these type of changes only matter to a few people. 90% of the general public buy OEM stuff and barely know what's inside the case. 

The top post clarified when it changed:
&gt;The 340.52 driver is responsible, and was released July 2014.

And another poster clarified that solutions were found but also ""fixed"" to keep people out, not just casual users
&gt;At some point it was working, then another driver update disabled it, then people found a way around it, then Nvidia decided to become more sneaky, then people fixed that, then Nvidia decided to introduce even more checks inside the driver. Most people kinda stopped caring much since GPU-PhysX wasn't really appealing anyway.

In the OP's case, he is NOT even using the AMD card for anything. It is merely in the PCIE slot sitting there. He is still using Nvidia GPU's but the Nvidia GPU detects the AMD driver and shuts down the chance for PhysX. 


It's nearly the same situation with passing through a GPU in virtualized environments (vGPU). AMD allows it for any card. Nvidia disables this for their GTX lines and you have to do a work around for ESXi to use it. Quadros will passthrough just fine.  It just done for the sake of increasing profit margins.

I would assume this is because NVidia can't guarantee the performance of PhysX in the system if there is an AMD processor in the mix. It simply eliminates a variable in troubleshooting especially if something doesn't work well and a person complains.  Maybe it is also already a known issue and is disabled because of that fact.  I guess its a problem is they eliminate a known issue by disabling something they know will cause an issue with end user experience.

Unfortunately, that's one of the reasons you have seen them. They can be expensive, so the manufacturer has an incentive to make them. Plus they're a bigger upgrade over what people have now.

"For a small business it must be tough to have a decent profit margin. When you only get $10 or $20 for a job but it takes 3 or 4 hours to do and maybe only 2 or 3 people come in for the day, or nobody...it adds up or doesn't. You have  to pay employees and rent and whatever else. One employee making poverty wage of $20,000 a year is still a lot of money you need to make back. You can easily go under.  GeekSquad and all that are just complete bullshit. But at the same time, I find it hard to see how a local shop stays above the water line. I never worked for one though. Almost every single small mom &amp; pop type shop, not just computers, but anything, have closed around me. 

Also there are folks that have someone else build their PC for them. They'll get a really well done interior, lots of attention given, etc, all in their budget but don't want to pay the person for their time really; just the hardware.

"So look, I exclusively used a TitanFall XBONE controller for a while with the wireless adapter. Some terrible drift on the left stick has manifested so I bought a Steam Controller for 40USD from a fellow redditor. It's on the way to my place right now so I can't give you a definitive review.

From all of the research I've done, the controller has a fairly steep learning curve - especially if you're used to the ""standard"" dual joystick controller. However, it is way more versatile for use in way more games. Check out Woodsie's videos on YouTube for some of the use cases. You'll have to add the Origin/UPlay games to Steam in order to use the Steam Controller. Also you can only configure the SC in Big Picture mode. This is annoying. Check out the /r/SteamController subreddit for more details.

I noticed you mentioned using the PS3 controller. I'm actually trying that right now. It's waay more of a pain in the ass than using the XBONE controller, which is plug and play using MicroUSB or the 25 dollar wireless adapter. It does use the onboard bluetooth on my PC, which is nice, but the actual design of the controller is extremely dated.

I bought a PC in 2004 which had decent specs at the time, but didn't replace it until 2013.  I upgraded a few things in it, and it was basically running an 8400 GS 512 mb card, which is ridiculously bad, but it ran Half-Life 2 okay haha.  

Anyway, I finally decided to save up and get a new pre-build, due to fear of building my own.  So I found a sale going on newegg and they insanely marked down a prebuilt PC twice due to two interfering sales between president's day and valentines day.  So it knocked the price of the PC from $889 to $360.  The build was 8320 FX 3.5 GHz, GTX 650, 8gb DDR3 and 1 tb HDD.  The mobo isn't the greatest and the PSU was shit, but it played last gen games perfectly well and the price was so cheap so I didn't pass up on newegg's mistake.  Then earlier this year I upgraded the PSU (to a CX600, but lesson learned, I'll do better next time) and then the graphics card to a GTX 970.  Temps were high so I decided to get a hyper 212 evo next.

After installing the cooler, and having to deal with taking out my mobo and putting it all together again, I basically felt like I had ascended because my fear of PC building just disappeared.

Just because an action comes from a woman doesn't mean she wasn't influenced by ""patriarchy."" Caroline Norton's actions, in my opinion, were considered feminist only because it fought the notion that children were inherently property of their fathers. It might have been considered a small step in the right direction at the time, but it still exhibits strong patriarchal influence in that it was based on the same patriarchal gender roles that it ended up enforcing.

&gt;The origins of patriarchy are closely related to the concept of gender roles, or the set of social and behavioral norms that are considered to be socially appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. Much work has been devoted to understanding why women are typically thought to inhabit a domestic role while men are expected to seek professional satisfaction outside of the home. This division of labor is frequently mapped onto a social hierarchy in which males' freedom to venture outside of the home and presumed control over women is perceived as superior and dominant. As such, rather than working to destablize the historical notion of patriarchy, much literature assess the origins of patriarchy, or a social system in which the male gender role acts as the primary authority figure central to social organization, and where fathers hold authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and entails female subordination.

"This has been a known issue since July 2014.

See the article here: http://vrworld.com/2014/07/31/nvidia-disables-gpu-physx-2nd-non-nv-gpu-installed/

The two main questions OP has been asking were:
Why is it being disabled?
&gt;According to Nvidia, GPU PhysX is disabled when a non-Nvidia GPU is present because the company says a high quality experience in such a scenario can’t be guaranteed. Such a combination would preclude users from utilizing using key features such as high performance communication between CUDA and the graphics API. Unfortunately for many users Nvidia says it has not found a full-proof way to detect whether or not the non-Nvidia GPU is truly idle throughout the application’s lifetime, so CPU PhysX is used instead ensuring a quality experience for all

And why does it work with Intel Onboard?
&gt;This issue should not arise in systems that have Intel GPUs that switch between onboard and dedicated (Nvidia) because of Nvidia’s Optimus technology.

Why can't Nvidia work with AMD to be able to reliably detect whether or not an AMD GPU is idle?  Nobody knows, but you should probably be yelling at AMD.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"That was a 3rd party not AMD. They wanted hardware from AMD so they could try to modify drivers to get it to work.

&gt;The team sought support from AMD in the form of a Radeon HD4800 series sample, so they could work out a similar solution for it, but AMD rejected it telling it wasn't a venture worth investing product samples and PR information on, clearly a case of them downplaying the issue to evade possible action from NVIDIA on supporting the use of its proprietary technologies in violation of license agreements. After being denied support from a company they were banking the most on, they were left to their own plight against NVIDIA who have a history of an aggressive business model, even more so after it was known NGOHQ.com may have reverse engineered drivers, a clear violation of the EULA. 

So AMD and NVIDIA didn't have licencing, and a 3rd party wanted to do it anyway and wanted AMD to provide hardware and support.

From the source:

&gt;
The bad news is we still don’t have access to any HD 4800 hardware yet. It is very important for this project to receive AMD’s support on both developer and PR levels. It seems that AMD still is not being cooperative, we get the feeling that they want this project to fail. Perhaps their plans are to strangle PhysX since AMD and Intel have Havok. We truly hope this is not the case since “format wars” are really bad for the consumers (For example: Blu-ray vs. HD-DVD).

&gt;Before we get to the good news, I’m going to ask you to hold on to something steady as some of you are going to feel a bit dizzy after you hear this. The truth is… Nvidia is now helping us with the project and it seems they are giving us their blessings. It’s very impressive, inspiring and motivating to see Nvidia's view on this. Why they help us? My best guess would be: They probably want to take on Intel with CUDA and to deal with the latest Havok threat from both AMD and Intel. 

So they say that Nvidia offered their support (to help stop HAVOK from gaining market share) while not actually having to do anything.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"HDR and SDR are both color depth sdr= 24b and HDR=32b. 

The game you mention is a PC exclusive. The games i mentioned are multi plat form. Monitors have had HDR for quite some time but not TVs. Consoles are made for TVs. Consoles have the ability to process in 32 bit color but they DON'T USE 32b images because 95% of the TVs out there do not display it and the overhead is unreal. Any dev who works on consoles and wastes time with 32b color images is an idiot because of the performance impact. This is one of the reasons that consoles hold PCs back. Guess how PC porting is stream lined. We get our 32b color from post processing effects on ports.

*Some* PC exclusives offer 32bit modes but most still don't use 32b images. We get our color depth from post processing.

&gt;(Rx*Ry*depth)*FPS. This means that for 4k at 140 hz at 10-bit color you need: (3840*2160*32)*140. This equates to just over 37Gbit/s. Even DisplayPort 1.3 cannot do this. HDR isn't special, nor is it new. My point is that HDR has nothing to do with bandwidth, color depth does, and we've had that forever.

This is why I said 4k at 120HZ in the title. HDR and color depth are the same thing.


The OP is about 1440p UW and 4K at high frame rates. HDR and color depth go hand in hand (they are the same thing.) Open up some image files from your favorite games and see what they are actually encoded in.  

Both Nvidia and AMD will soon be releasing cards powerful enough to run 4K 32b color in the 120 HZ range and monitors will start becoming available to reflect that.

"Best buy doesn't hire tech support. They take salespeople and run them through A+.

My brother had a friend who worked for best buy geek squad. He gave my brother his old laptop and told him the HD was failing. It wasn't the HD, it was the battery. The battery would cut out and lose power, so the computer would instantly power off instead of doing a safe force shutdown/hibernate. So obviously the HD would 'corrupt' when that happened. Which was repaired by him using the factory image. 

He wasn't a bad guy, he just didn't know that much about computers. He didn't even chkdsk, or consider that the HD was corrupting due to the power loss. 

I mean I get how its difficult to troubleshoot power issues over the phone. When i first got it it looked like a HD issue, since the drive wouldn't boot and chkdsk repaired errors. But when the damn machine turns off instantly without warning instead of doing a force shutdown, then it shows as corrupt. It should be really really obvious that its a power issue.

There is a difference between owning a product that you've never tested and saying ""it works exceptionally"" even if you have no idea how much life is left in the shitty chinese caps or what the PSU is performing like, and then the CX just having lame caps and often failing (which is from RMA statistics).

Meanwhile people would probably downvote me and call me a console basher just because I want the consoles to die out, and see developers focus on PCs, see more hardware companies rise from the ashes, and so on and so forth. Yes, consoles do and always will hurt gaming-regardless of whether or not someone is aware that PC is better in every way or not-playing on consoles is still not having the positive effect playing on PC would have. I mean, I understand exclusives, but in an ideal world without consoles, there would be no exclusives.

He decided to go ask his old friend Jacob what to do. Jake said, ""Funny you should ask. I too sent my son to Israel, and he also came back a Christian. Perhaps we should go see the rabbi and ask him what we should do."" So they went to see the rabbi. The rabbi said, ""Funny you should ask. I too sent my son to Israel. He also came back a Christian.

"Three friends, seeking great fortune, visit a newly discovered pyramid. Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

I recommend never buying Nvidia again. They are the reason there's so much proprietary this and Nvidia/AMD-only that. They can't just make better cards for their money; they have to wreck the market with patented shit and closed-source everything. AMD,  on the other hand, just shifted gears into a highly cross-platform and open source business strategy. They're all about getting paid for making gaming better, not for trapping customers in a cage of proprietary tech.

I agree with you in saying that they might not be doing it as it's even more niche than 4K, and would likely only appeal to the gaming or sports communities that also have 120Hz monitors.

I mean, seriously, you cannot play games properly, you cannot do homework or job properly if the task demands editing .docx files for whatever reason, you cannot use amd cards on it without suffering really bad on performance, you cannot use most windows software with proper parity cause reasons.

Then what you can do? edit the gui? edit a meaningless detail on the system just because?.

Do stuff you can also do on a proper pc with windows or on a website?.

What is the point of it?.

At this point i think linux users are too busy coding and tinkering with their systems, because well.....They cannot do much else, can you?.

Which would also explain the massive linux slacktivism (that did not even work because steam still has 1% of its users on linux, which somehow makes it even more sad).

What GPU are you considering? the gtx970 is very good card or if you have a high budget then an gtx 980 or 980 ti will spit in any games face and run them perfectly. keep in mind your power supply, some cards are very power hungry i would go for about 750w which would be more then enogh and would allow for future upgrading.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

TestDisk is available for all OS's, but I've had the best luck with Linux. As OP showed, if it is an external HDD, it is possible that the enclosure is shot.

  - 8 GB ram should be fine for now.  Easy to upgrade later. 

  - Case is a little ugly, I'd reevaluate that.

""Estimated 80% chance of recovery"", yeah right.  That's deliberately deceptive as to what the actual drive status is.

That they're not charging to ""evaluate"" because they can sucker in more people that way doesn't change this -- playing on a customer's greed or desperation doesn't justify dishonesty.  That's the rationalization of a con man.

If you're not going to give an honest report from your free evaluation because it doesn't make you any money, then don't do free evaluations.  Do what honest people do and charge a reasonable amount for evaluation that can be applied to your fee should the customer decide to have you attempt a recovery.

&gt; I mean, seriously, you cannot play games properly,

You don't need games or an AMD graphics card to get practical use. Games are a nicety, not a necessity.

Actually, with Word Online you can.

&gt; you cannot use most windows software with proper parity cause reasons.

You don't need most Windows software to get practical use.

&gt; Then what you can do? edit the gui? edit a meaningless detail on the system just because?.

You can do what I do—schoolwork including the use of .docx files, play games, programming, web browsing—things people typically do. I've done all these things on Linux Mint, making it very practical for me and the others who use it. :-)

&gt; Do stuff you can also do on a proper pc with windows or on a website?.

&gt; What is the point of it?.

A proper PC is one where the user is able to operate and use it however they want to, which is what I and other Linux users are doing when we use our PCs running Linux. I am sorry you do not understand.

&gt; At this point i think linux users are too busy coding and tinkering with their systems, because well.....They cannot do much else, can you?.

&gt; Which would also explain the massive linux slacktivism (that did not even work because steam still has 1% of its users on linux, which somehow makes it even more sad).

"When AMD breaks 50% discrete marketshare, we'll talk about their success.  They've been hemorrhaging customers for a decade, so obviously you are wrong.  Some people just need to come out of their bubbles.  I only concern myself with AMD is doing, has done, and their impact on PC gaming.  I don't really care about their PowerPoint slideshows and abandonware.

&gt;Poor persecuted you. It's everyone else that has the issue, not you passing off opinion as fact. 

For what it's worth, and you probably don't care, I spent a lot of time fighting Nvidia propaganda on this subreddit and others up until last year, when Reddit was heavily an Nvidia circlejerk.  The tables have turned in recent months, unfortunately the AMD propagandists have moral authority on their side.  As if spreading misinformation is fine, as long as you work for the ""good guys"".

neither, HW ID(CPU+MB) is used to get your license now. (Actually it could be saved in BIOS on computers bought with the license, on upgraded PCs there's no key, just HW ID)

&gt;Do I need to wipe the drive beforehand

NO

&gt;Are any of the initial setup options for privacy (first boot options) worth keeping on for anything? Seems like I'd want to disable most all of them.

I disable absolutely everything now, I used to keep the absolute last one on though(report issues to MS)


&gt;In terms of drivers... ASUS has their support page at...

Use that if something doesn't work.

&gt;I'm assuming I'll still have to go through the process at

I find it pointless, just use local account and not online account. There are some useful tips though.

&gt;Is there bloat in the installer I will DL at

You can save yourself the hassle and DL .iso directly from here 

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench

then use Rufus to install it(GPT for UEFI as a partiton scheme)

"Here's a long joke, but it's worth the read:

Three friends, seeking great fortune, visit a newly discovered pyramid. Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""",pcmasterrace,0,1200.0

I have a 32"" 1080 and a 49"" 4K on my desk and the biggest benefit (aside from all those glorious surplus pixels) is being able to have ten things open and visible at once. Right now I'm watching a movie in 1080 (takes forever to get through them because I keep pausing) while keeping Reddit open, my Excel spreadsheet (tracking work stuff) and two Notepads with stuff for projects I'm working on.

The content will catch up, and when (if) I move up to curved, the current 4K will go in the living room.

One thing I'll say is Shadowplay doesn't depend on your cpu much if not at all - I can stream high quality 1080p 60 fps easy - OBS for some reason on my i5 4670 k clocked at 4.5 still tells me my cpu load is too high at 720p 30fps and fails.  I'm sure it might be an issue with my OBS settings but I've gone though them over and over trying to fix it but no deal - then shadowplay just works so smoothly and great and I know it'll get more and more features add. ,pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"A centrifuge is basically just a heavily reinforced rotor which can spin extremely fast. A laboratory centrifuge will have mountings on the rotor to fit commonly used vessels into. Such as test tubes or boiling tubes for a small centrifuge, or large beakers or buckets for a bigger one.

Usually there are either two or four mountings. If there are two, then they will be opposed, at 180 ^o to each other. If there are four, they will be 90 ^o to each other. The mountings are also pivoted, allowing the tubes or buckets to swing outwards and become horizontal when the rotor is spinning.

When spinning at high speed, the centrifugal force generated simulates a massive increase in gravity on the mountings and anything mounted in them. This causes rapid settling of the contents according to density.

For example, if you did a reaction which produced a very fine powdery precipitate which you wanted to isolate from a liquid, you could use a centrifuge to force the solid precipitate down to the bottom of your test tubes. Then you could just pour the liquid off afterwards.

In a medical setting, centrifuges are often used to separate the components of blood. Which is a complex mixture, containing red cells, white cells, platelets, proteins, fats and plasma. When subjected to a centrifuge, all these separate out. If I remember correctly, you get white cells at the bottom - they are heaviest. Then red cells above them. Then platelets and other proteins. Then the clear liquid plasma, with fats right at the top.

The most important aspect of using a centrifuge, whether using a small or large machine, is to balance the rotor. So if you have only one sample you want to spin down, you have to weigh it and then put another sample the same weight (of water, for example) in the mounting opposite, for balancing.

An unbalanced centrifuge is extremely dangerous - the forces involved can generate powerful vibrations and destroy the machine. Think about how much a washing machine vibrates on its spin cycle when the drum isn't balanced properly, and those rarely go faster than 1000 rpm. A centrifuge can spin 10 or 100 times faster than any washing machine, which magnifies the forces involved. There are many stories to be found about large centrifuges which someone forgot to balance bouncing around the lab, only stopping when they bounce far enough to pull out their power cables.",chemistry,1,1200.0

980M destroys the GTX 680, and is about equvilant to a GTX 780. Only variance occurs at the type of effects going on and the optimization for the card. Last time I checked, a 960 is no where near a 780. The card is more in line with a slightly underclocked reference GTX 970. a 970M is closer to that of a slightly underclocked 960. Overclocking your card (which is very doable in bulky laptops like many clevos and msi laptops) typically gets them up to speed.

For Desktop GTX 980 For Notebooks, although it costs as much as a 980 Ti, it beats the regular GTX 980 by simply consuming 20 watts less (compared to reference design) and has 2x the VRAM. 

Depending on your definition of modern, I guess GTA V is decent where a modded one on High/Very High settings runs anywhere from 50-90fps variance with avg of ~78fps. Can play games like DOTA2 and Starcraft easily on 4K with decent 40fps maxed out. Having overclocked that is. I could easily get ultra 1080p if willing to sacrafice fps for slightly better than console quality (~30fps) on hard core games like crysis (which i don't own so can't test, but I have tried with games like arma 3 and gta V which do get 40fps).

According to estimates by PC part picker, similar machines to my laptop would be in the $1400 range including keyboard(dome), mouse(DS100 MSI), OS(Win8+Linux), 2133MHz 32GB ram(HyperX), etc. They all add up. When people compare laptops, they only compare the raw build, the box containing all the goodies (aka case+everything inside it). I'd save $600 if I went the PC route at the cost of portability, 4x the power usage, slightly higher temps (I have literally never went above 80 degrees with normal stock fans and pipes), and 43.75% (can't use that .5GB in 970) of the VRAM. Not so black and white especially considering it for people like me who take it on the go a lot.

"Probably because they want to phase out having a dedicated PhysX card since that has major performance pitfalls that might not be obvious to most users.

[Specifically when you pair a weak cars to a strong card, running the simulation on the GPU might actually decelerate your system which isn't intuitive for most people.](https://youtu.be/cbww3dhzK0M)

In general it's been obsoleted by better optimized code on CPUs with SIMD+vector extensions in addition to multi core processing which has the advantage of better latency and therefore performance for most jobs.

"Yeah man, the 5450 was a significant upgrade from intel ""hd"" 3000, i bought one for my brothers computer, he wanted to play warframe and such, it didnt work out well for him but he didnt mind the sub 20fps at his monitors resolution (1600x900), i kept telling him he could get much higher than 20fps if he turned down the res to 720p as it has ran a ton of games decently at 720.

I like your story, i can relate to it a lot, though im only 21, and had recently just got a job last year and had put together enough money to buy myself some parts, though i did buy my parts in a weird order, and spread out through 4 months, I bought the GTX 970, and Pentium G3258 in july this year and since i had no other computer to put them in, they sat in my bedroom right behind the laptop i had at the time (HP ProBook 6560b, i5-2520m, 8gb ram upgraded, radeon 6470m) so for 3 months i would sit there playing my games at sub 30, while being slapped in the face by my boxes hahah. 

After those 3 long excruciating months, i had the money to buy a psu, case, motherboard, ram, and a cheapo acer 1080p monitor, and put it together. Ran everything perfect for what i wanted to play like gta5. It only ran at 30fps, it would go higher but it would stutter, but a few days after i put it together i won $250 from a scratch off, put it towards my i7 4790k, and bam, my computer is finished. Just black friday i picked up a logitech G230 for my brother, a G600 mouse and a logitech G930 for myself.

Well i cant exactly say finished.... ;). Just ordered a corsair strafe rgb to ascend my fingers from this horrible microsoft wireless keyboard, thanks to /u/monron giving me a Corsair code last minute. And im planning on getting a new case, better quality PSU, and a CPU cooler as i dont like my i7 hitting 100 C when encoding videos.

"Not specific to Noctua but you can also automate fans to change RPM based on temps. If they're PWM fans, which use pulses to move a magnet instead of voltage changes then the RPM ramp up and down is even smoother, thus quieter and there's more range to which RPM the fan can go. In my case, my PWM fan doesn't even turn on until I reach at least 50C. So is definitely a way to make it ""silent"", not silent like a passive system but silent to the point it's not noticeable.

When you play a game for the first time, you expect it to rock – to be worth every nickel you spent on it. We expect that too. And while we can't guarantee that you'll never encounter a glitch (hard as we might try), we can guarantee that we'll make it right if something goes wrong.

The Origin Great Game Guarantee: If you don't love it, just return it!

You may return EA full game downloads (PC or Mac) and participating third party titles purchased on Origin for a full refund. Refund requests can be made within 24 hours after you first launch the game, within seven days from your date of purchase, or within seven days from the game’s release date if you pre-ordered, whichever comes first. And if you purchase a new EA game within the first 30 days of its release date and can’t play it due to technical reasons within EA’s control, you can request a refund within 72 hours after you first launch the game instead of 24.

Here's how to return a game with the Great Game Guarantee:

    Visit your Order History and select the Request a Refund link next to any eligible product.
    Complete and submit the Refund Request Form.
    You'll get a response within 48 hours and your refund within 10 days.

"~~Google: crysis gameworks tesselation~~

~~read a couple of articles, watch a couple of videos and let's talk then.~~

Edit: 

1. Crysis 2 tessellation problem predates Gameworks and has been blown out of proportion because crysis 2 debug wireframe output didn't account for LOD, culling etc. As it is often the case initial findings were widely published, but explanation was not and I was not aware of it. In this case I stand corrected.

2. While there is no proof that Nvidia actively sabotaged AMD performance within Gameworks, but at the same time just keeping it not optimized for AMD hurts it a lot, keeping it closed doesn't allow AMD and game devs optimize it either.

"GPU memory is handled via opaque references at the driver level. 

What this means is that if the driver is aware that when a CUDA program finishes and needs to pass data to a DX/OGL program on the GPU, it can just pass that reference instead of copying out of the GPU and then back in which is incredibly slow due to latency.

This is why black box models are good, they give flexibility to implementors to do weird things like that as long as final result is the same.

On CPU's when you copy or move data from one register to another nothing actually happens to the data. The CPU merely renames the register to the one you're writing to or make that register point back until the value's actually start to diverge.

"Game devs don't have the same access as a vendor. 

Sometimes you want separate technologies to work together without explicitly specifying or otherwise give flexibility to the hardware/driver so there's room for improvement in the future.

If we don't do this a situation like x86 can arise where there's a ton of legacy crud that needs to be carried forward at every step like the infamous A20 line or real vs protected vs long (16 vs 32 vs 64 bit) modes in x86.

CPU's too actually often merge separate instructions or split instructions or rename things when they should be copied all the time - it's one of the reason's why x86 is able to be so fast despite having a god awful instruction set from a hardware perspective.

It's the GPU that's the issue, although it's all from 2009 the CPU could handle a much faster GPU than that so if you upgraded the GPU you could play games great. 

You likely need a PSU upgrade as well, 6 years is a long time for any PSU, so you need to check what it is and ask here, if it's something dodgy and old it will need changing.

As it is now the GPU isn't as bad as everyone is saying, it's not good by a long shot but it's equivalent to a low end dedicated GPU like the R7 240.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"It's the most demanding game you own so it only vibrates then because it's the one that makes it spin to the point where it vibrates.

What do you mean? If the fan is vibrating because it's faulty past a certain RPM that only Fallout forces it to run at because it's making your CPU hotter than any other game, then it's obviously only gonna show the fault in fallout it's pretty obvious stuff. Software can't make a vibration happen just magically, if you have a physical vibration in your pc then it's always related to a faulty component like a faulty fan that can't spin past a certain RPM without vibration.

The feminists also say that the ""toxic"" culture is causing the significantly lower number of female contributors compared to male.

Noctua P12 would be fine.

Phanteks PH-F120MP would be ok.


Just needs to be a radiator fan, an SP120 from Corsair would be fine too although I don't particularly like those.

you should be able to RMA the fan with Cooler Master anyway if it's under warranty, but obviously you'd still need a new one unless you didn't use the pc for weeks while it's replaced. 


&gt;i thought the cm hyper 212 evo was the best cheap fan around?

Hang on, the 212 evo is not a fan, that's a heatsink. The fan is a separate part that just clips off, you take the broken fan off, take off the mounting brackets at either side and attach them to the new fan then just slot the new fan onto the 212 EVO and you're done.

Just needs to be a static pressure radiator fan, so not a Corsair AF fan or any other airflow fan - those are terrible for heatsinks.

Loads of people use nf f12s on their 212 EVO

Also the point of watercooling now is to have the adaptability down the road. Buy a loop now with a 40 dollar am3 block, and buy a zen or i7 one later when I upgrade.

"There is a possibility which nobody else has really touched on - you could be suffering from heavy metal poisoning from solder somewhere on the pipework.

Traditionally, solder was a lead-tin alloy. But this has fallen out of fashion because of the lead, so now, lead-free solders are used. There are various different alloys used in replacement of lead. Some are mostly tin with about 1% copper. Some contain bismuth or silver instead of lead.

But another one commonly used in water plumbing contains antimony. While this is not so toxic as lead, it isn't completely harmless and could cause the kind of symptoms you are experiencing.

Believe it or not, pills made of pure antimony metal were once sold as a cure for constipation, and were intended to be re-used. This was a long time ago, before the invention of flushing toilets, so you re-used the pill by fishing it out of your excrement, washing it and taking it again when required. A microscopic amount of antimony would dissolve from the pill to form the active dose, so a typical pill would last many years even with daily use.

Of course, anything which cures constipation can in principle cause diarrhea. So it is quite possible that the water system in your house has at least one solder joint made with an antimony-containing solder. It has probably taken a couple of years for the solder to be degraded by water flow, so now enough antimony could be dissolving in the water to cause your symptoms.

There is an easy way to check if this is the problem. Send another water sample to a testing lab, but ask them to specifically test for antimony content. It is extremely unlikely that water could be contaminated by antimony from a ground or bedrock source, so if antimony is present, it is almost certainly from a solder joint.",chemistry,7,1200.0

"&gt;The game you mention is a PC exclusive.

This makes no difference. My point is that it is in no way old news, and is no way hard to implement.

&gt;Monitors have had HDR for quite some time but not TVs.

Depends on what you mean by HDR. If you mean 32 bit color depth, yes and no. TVs have historically had some support for 32 bit color depth. Mine is a living example.

&gt;Consoles are made for TVs.

This is irrelevant. We are discussing AMD's plans to support HDR on their GPUs.

&gt;Consoles have the ability to process in 32 bit color but they DON'T USE 32b images because 95% of the TVs out there do not display it and the overhead is unreal.

I think a more likely reason is that calculating in a lower color depth is a very easy, hardly noticeable, way for them to increase performance. Most people playing on console wouldn't notice.

&gt;Any dev who works on consoles and wastes time with 32b color images is an idiot

It's not that hard to just change color depth for games. Hell DirectX can do it in a single function.

&gt;Some PC exclusives offer 32bit modes but most still don't use 32b images. We get our color depth from post processing.

Again; changing bit-depth isn't difficult in terms of calculation depth. The harder part would be converting textures, but even then, it is an industry standard to make textures larger than what you need anyway.

&gt;HDR and color depth are the same thing.

No it is not; at least, not what they are selling to you. They are selling to you factory-developed tone-mapping curves in-built into the display as well as deeper blacks. This sort of HDR is independent of any input single and as a result regardless of bit-depth.

&gt;HDR and color depth go hand in hand

In the same sense that dithering does, sure.

&gt;they are the same thing.

No they are not; again, in the context of the product they are trying to sell you. They are trying to sell you techniques they use to widen their display's contrast range.

&gt;Both Nvidia and AMD will soon be releasing cards powerful enough to run 4K 32b color in the 120 HZ range and monitors will start becoming available to reflect that.

Just barely. It will leave just under 200MBit/s of bandwidth to spare. Why is this a problem you're probably thinking. Shitty cables. If you're cable can't perfectly (or surpass) the DisplayPort 1.3 standard you're not gonna get that.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

BTW, if you think about the ou in many british spelling compared to the simple o like in Honor, it makes sense. At least the way we pronounce it here, it makes no sense for any word spelled with an ou since that would indicate it's pronounced as a long o, which it isn't. It's a short soft simple o sound.

"Dota's basically the grand daddy of the genre.  Sorta, Starcrraft's custom map AoS is the first I think but this entire genre is based on Dota's formula.  At the moment, Dota 2 is the most hard core of the genre while Heros of the Storm is more geared towards casual players.  However, Dota 2 have tons of custom games for casual players in the arcade section.  

Dota 2 has the best monetization model in gaming right now.  You get access to every game play related feature and the only thing that you need to pay are cosmetic items, different sound track, and announcers.  You also randomly get cosmetic item after a match not that frequent but still nice.  It also got Steamwork shop and marketplace integrated so you can trade and buy cosmetics (not all though, but you can get some nice looking stuff for pennies).  There's really not reason not to at least give it a try.  It will take a lot of time if you want to not suck at it though unless you only play custom games.  

Heros of the Storm took the LoL route of monetization where you have to grind for in game currencies to unlock heroes and then grind with that hero to unlock the skill tree.  It takes a very long time to unlock a hero.  You can also pay with real money to unlock a hero but it costs a lot.  To unlock every hero with real money will cost couple hundred bucks.  There's also additional cosmetic stuff that you can buy with money.  

Smite is also popular right now and it's a 3rd person Dota and it's a pretty good spin on the Dota formula.    Good monetization model where you can buy every God (hero) in a package for $30-40 (something like that, pretty reasonable price).  or you can unlock them one by one with in game currency that you earn like the LoL model.  The premium currency unlocks cosmetics stuff only and you can get them for free by logging inevery day or during events so you can get some free cosmetics if you play long enough.

Oh for FPS, I'm assuming that you already know/played Team Fortress 2. (also get Counter Strike GO, basically a must own for any PC gamer that plays FPS).  Be on the look out for Overwatch.  It's in close Beta right now but it's pretty much the most anticipated FPS since TF2 and Half Life 2.  Paladin (by the same Company as smite)  seems to be pretty similar although I haven't tried it yet.  

Also, Tribes Ascend is alive again.  Its F2P with similar business model as Smite.   It's a team based FPS with jet pack and large open maps that focuses on going really, really fast (100km/h is considered pretty slow in that game).  Takes a lot of skill to go very fast of course.  Shooting is projectile based and you'll have to shoot based on where their going to be while moving and flying at high speed.  The older games in the Tribes series also just go released for free",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"idk, I ran a local shop/internet cafe.  It brought in losses for years till I took more control of it.

We charged 50$ for a basic diagnostic and fix.  Anything more, or parts would be 100$+parts cost.  

under previous management they were getting 5-25 repairs a week the problem was the guy running the shop didn't give a fuck and most of the computers would sit there till the customers came to pick them up and took them some place else. We'd just end up being storage.  Once I took the reins it was normally 1 day.  I'd start as soon as it came in.   The turn around became very high, word of mouth spread and soon enough I was spending most days on repairs. getting 2-5 a day.  Which working a 14-18 hour day was fine for me.  We started to make a very decent amount of cash very quickly.

"My inner devil's advocate is wondering if it should really make any difference that the actual drive works. You sent a problematic unit to a company that deals in getting data back from it, and they told you how much it will cost to have them do that for you. Sure it would be nice if they took the severity of the issue into consideration more but the end result is the same either way, so should they really be expected to? Should it be their responsibility to make sure you don't send them a faulty unit that you happen to be able to fix yourself, when for all they know you might have mission critical data stuck on that drive with no affinity for DIY troubleshooting?

Skylake is slightly better for single core work because of the 14 nm process used. And produces less heat for the same reason. Although an aio water cooler would fix the heat and with a build like that it's the only way to go beside full loop.

"Well I have a story, but unfortunately its from a console (gasp!). 3 years ago I bought a PS3 (it was dirt cheap and I had a Mac for my computing needs, plus didn't have the time to game that much then because of school). It was brand new so of course I spent 10+ hours a day every day for a week playing AC Rev.

My dad got a pissed at me playing and said that he doesn't see the point of spending so many hours on video games. Initially I just brush him off, but when he complained for the 3rd time in an hour I knew what to do. I fire up one of the free games (The Shoot), connect 2 PS Move controllers and bam we're playing together. Had so much fun that day. Now my dad plays games like Bioshock Infinite, CoD BlOps and NFS Shift on the PS3 more than me 😂 I'm thinking of leaving the PS3 when I move to Mumbai in a few months, though I'll be sad to part with Uncharted and The Last of Us.

"That's a really nice home server for $260. I was going to say that a Synology NAS is cheaper, but it actually isn't, a Synology costs around $139 (2x HDD bay version), but doesn't come with drives, so add on another $50 each for the two 1 TB drives, and both this and the Synology are around $260.    

That all being said:    

 - You're better off with this IF you need something beyond just a NAS. This will do video streaming, a game server, or can just act as an extra PC for whatever. You *will* have to spend time setting this up yourself.    
 - You're better off with the Synology if you only need a NAS or any of the apps available in the Synology ecosystem. You're really buying an experience with a Synology, not just a device, for [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MhRIe1onJ4) look at all the packages.    

I liken it to comparing a PC to an iPad (the Synology is the iPad in this analogy). If you just want a NAS you can plug in and it ""just works"" with or without third party packages, then get the Synology, if you want complete freedom/flexibility then get the PC.

"Ok here. 4K is so GPU dependant, so that means it heavily uses the GPU. Obviously, it is very hard to run 4K. When I say it doesn't bottleneck, it's because the 980Ti is already maxed out, so it doesn't matter how good your CPU is doing as the 980Ti is already doing all that it can. With any 3x AAA title, good luck getting that much over 60 FPS, that's why the CPU doesn't matter.

Now, in 1080p, the 980Ti would absolutely crush. The 980Ti could get like 100 FPS on a bunch of games at 1080p, and since it isn't that hard to run, your CPU does matter. That's why if lets say my system competed with a 4790K, it would get crushed by the 4790K (although my FPS would still be decent)

To reiterate, the CPU doesn't matter that much in 4K because it will never get to the point that the CPU is that needed (as the frames don't go much over 60 FPS in the first place, and the GPU can't use any extra CPU power)

If you think about it, it's actually a GPU bottleneck really... As the GPU isn't powerful enough to use the CPU's powers (Assuming the CPU was something like a 4790K. I guess this is technically why my CPU's are doing fine, as the GPU is a bottleneck at 4K due to how hard it is to run.

"If you don't have warranty that covers this damage, take it apart. There are multiple layers in front of the actual LCD and it looks like the liquid is stuck between them. Wipe it off, let it dry and presto. Just make sure you don't pinch the panel while snapping on in the inner casing that holds the layers together, you'll fuck up the edges forever. Guess how I figured that out.

Or, you know, take it to a repair shop if you don't trust yourself with the reassembly and it's still cheaper than buying a replacement. No shame in this one, depending on the internal construction it's really easy to hurt the panel if you're inexperienced.",pcmasterrace,3,1200.0

If you want both 1440p and 144Hz, my best suggestion is [this Acer monitor](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0173PEX34/?), but at that price point, I'd much rather see you upgrade your GPU to something like a 980ti.

Let me buy dinner to make it up to you. May I join you?"" He nods. The woman is a stimulating conversationalist, stunningly pretty, and the man finds they have a lot in common. He gets her phone number and asks, ""You are the most charming woman I've ever encountered. Are you this nice to every guy you meet?"" ""No,"" she replies. ""You just happened to catch my eye.""

"When running at their full spec, DVI/HDMI/DP all operate at very high frequencies. At high frequencies any sort of discontinuity in the transmission line dramatically reduces performance because of the reflections that it causes due to a change in impedance. The primary way to minimize these reflections is to minimize the impedance. A hand-crimped connector will never be as good as a factory machine-crimped connector.

As for how far you can go, it varies from card to card, so you will have to play around with yours to figure out what it can do. If you don't really know much about overclocking there are some great YouTube guides on how to do it.

As for cooling, I guess just make sure the card is getting plenty of fresh air. You can't really increase the effectiveness of the cooler (at least to my knowledge). You could always set a custom fan profile (through MSI Afterburner) and have the fan running full speed all the time during overclocking, which might help a little, although it is most likely already running full speed if it's at 100% usage anyways.

"The SATA port you have it plugged into may be on a second SATA controller that you haven't installed drivers for. Many motherboards have two SATA controllers, usually one is integrated into the chipset, and an additional one is used to provide extra SATA ports beyond what the chipset is capable of.

In this case, the BIOS knows both controllers are there, and can see both drives. However Windows only knows the one SATA controller, and doesn't see anything connected to the second. Look up the drivers for your motherboard and make sure you've installed everything -- chipset drivers, SATA drivers, RAID drivers, storage drivers, anything that sounds like it might be relevant. Alternately, try plugging the SSD into different SATA ports and see if that changes anything.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"I think you are trying to say that GPU-PhysX actually has something to do with GPU memory? Sorry but it seems you are forgetting about key points in the design. You're merely trying to explain why GPU processing is faster than CPU processing, but you list wrong reasons to that.

PhysX calculation is not a process that you can tie to GPU unit. In fact, PhysX, when included to the engine, becomes the limiting factor for max fps - it should process all the data it can every single frame. Every single released game with PhysX must wait until PhysX is finished calculating its stuff before each frame can be drawn (even for GPU-PhysX). We saw a benchmark (FluidMark) implemented it asynchronously at some point, but still no game ever included this technique. It merely allows the engine to draw a frame before PhysX is finished, which results in lagging particles if there are too many of them.

PhysX was designed for games and applications that run on CPU. It was not changed - all the processed data must be saved into process memory (not GPU memory). This is because PhysX is an extension to the game engine, and all logic it can do must be passed through process memory on runtime. Technically it never goes to GPU memory, it just happens that when you use GPU-PhysX, all the process gets calculated withing the GPU, but it's still a whole different process that uses a separate chunk of GPU memory, not tied to the main GPU rendering thread in any way.

So, in your words, the reference gets eventually passed to GPU memory, but it always passes the process memory first, each frame as a limiting factor. You can't change that as PhysX engine modules still work the way that allows them to be accessed from the game engine.

The reason why GPU mode is faster than CPU is just that a separate physics calculation unit (which happen to be the Nvidia GPU after Nvidia implemented this through CUDA) can do much more calculations than a CPU, *even* while the data still should be passed through the main process memory every single frame.

Also, it was confirmed by people that used patched Nvidia driver that GPU-PhysX works perfectly fine on AMD/Nvidia configurations.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Some people believe the stress put on your internal components from the expansion and contraction because of heat differences during startup and shut down lowers the life expectancy of your product.  In reality, this is not much different than going from idle to load temps and perpetual energy through a device also takes a toll.

Others argue that the worst thing you can do to a hard drive is spin it up.  However, modern OSs spin down HDDs when idle anyway to preserve power and lower heat.  My system has Windows and chrome on an ssd with most other programs on an HDD and ask games on another.  OSX and Fedora each reside with all their programs on respective ssds and have access to the HDDs for storage.  My HDDs basically never spin up unless I'm playing a game.

I sit in the camp that perpetually running something that was not designed to be perpetually run is bad.  Add to that that I must torn my computer on to select an OS, and there is no point in leaving one OS running all the time.  ",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Looking at GPU user benchmark, its not even testing any games (just synthetics), so it makes it a poor real world indicator in games.

GPUs can be easily tuned for a specific bencmark to produce as good result as possible. Games on the other hand are much more complicated, since pretty much every game needs special tuning to work properly. And some games just straight up work badly on one or another camp (hello gameworks).

So, if you really want to know gpu performance, you need to look for benchmarks that carefully test games you mean to play with as little variables as possible (youd be surprised what can cause lower performance) and that test config is as close as possible to yours. For example, its a known fact, that amd gpus works worse on slower cpus (like i3s) than nvidia simply due to higher dx11 overhead.
Also, testing fcat/minimum fps is a must, since those actually tell you how smooth game will actually be. What good is avarage 90fps, if its spiking from 300 and all the way down to 10fps.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"well, if the machine is purely for gaming at the time of purchase then you have a cogent argument there.

But people do other stuff with their computers, some of which likes big fast CPUs.

also we've reached a point due to various factors where a big CPU will last a long time, longer than a GPU would in the normal cycle of things (things are a bit pent up on that side due to being stuck on TSMC 28nm), I daresay there are a.. quantity of 2011 machines on their ~third graphics card in the wild.

Checking techreport, their 2600K review used a GTX460, It's quite feasible that would have gotten bumped to a GTX680 or a Radeon 7970, and then later to something like a GTX970, all the while the CPU would have been upto the task, and anyone with one (vs a 2500K) would have had that bit of extra cpu grunt for.. well, anything.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

This one seems more reasonable, yet I'm sure it was not about PhysX license but about CUDA license, and again Nvidia never clearly purposed it to AMD. They were only waiting for AMD to come up with a request on their own.

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if the driver lockout is partially AMD's fault. Some kind of driver-support deal expired, maybe?

"GPU PhysX has to work with GPU memeory to transfer data, yes. That's just how things work. 

I'm trying to explain why a black box model can do things differently than they appear from the outside. Reference passing works because from the interface's perspective things are working the same except faster. The behavior is implicit and depends on the driver versions being compatible. This is why input and output are the same . This process is also sometimes called thunking or lazy evaluation in CS. CPUs ate brought up because they do the same.
 

http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/03/x86-is-high-level-language.html

All physics has to be finished before the frame can be sent, that's true of any world logic or else we'd have inconsistent world state between frames. This doesn't necessarily impact FPS though because we usually run physics and environmental simulations concurrently and synthesise the two. This pipelined structure is not unique to physics; it is used heavily in network logic which is part of the reasons why MOBAs and FPSs all integrate animation/casting/travel latency or momentum. Next state is calculated then the previous state is dispatched to GPU. Next state is swapped with previous and the cycle repeats.

CPU physics is by far faster than GPU with a few notable exceptions: particle and mesh based methods. Fluids including water, smoke and fire are simulated with volumetric particles. Mesh based methods basically boil to cloth, skin and some other stuff but that's usually better directly done in the graphics API.

This is because CPUs are far better at heavily branched code such as deciding whether to objects are colliding, impulse displacement and the like. A GPU can only execute in warps with similar branching patterns because there's only one branch predictor shared within a cluster. See GCN's GCN compute unit's or Fermi's SMs for details.

This is also why so many engines have adopted PhysX as standard physics API without also adopting GPI acceleration - the CPU stuff has most of the useful and non gimicky stuff any way.

"If you've never tried a mechanical keyboard before, its not simply the ""click"", but the feel of the entire typing experience. You will *have* to try it out to know what I mean. There are many different types of key switches with different amounts of force required to register their presses, different ones that have a tactile bump that tell you when you've activated the key, ones with no bump at all, different ones that click when pressed down, combinations of these, and a lot more. Its good to be educated about the different types of key switches before finally investing into a mechanical keyboard, based off of your situation and preferences. Head to /r/MechanicalKeyboards if you want to see people with way too many keyboards and good recomendations. Personally, I'd recommend the Cooler Master Storm Quickfire series [here](http://www.amazon.com/CM-Storm-QuickFire-TK-Mechanical/dp/B00A378L10/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451646731&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cm+quickfire) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/Storm-QuickFire-Rapid-Tenkeyless-Mechanical/dp/B007VDKLLM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451646731&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cm+quickfire), or the popular Poker II from Massdrop. A good mechanical keyboard is definitely a worthy investment, as it will last you for a very long time and you can swap out the keycaps if they get damaged or if you want a different look. Also note that Razer's mech keyboards are lower quality than most other keyboards due to their special key switches manufactured in China, so don't trust Razer's keyboards no matter how flashy they look. You're better off with literally any other mechanical keyboard.

For your mouse, its personal preference but if you're going to play something ""serious"" like CS:GO I'd recommend *any* mouse from Logitech's gaming lineup since their sensors from the lowest to the highest pricepoint are trusted by pro players. 

Happy gaming!",pcmasterrace,3,1200.0

"~~That button lights only wasd,1 to 6 and arrow buttons for me. Should i do anything else to light up the extra buttons like you do?~~

Edit: found them. Will be a bit wall of text but may help you as well.~~


&gt;2.) How do I enable the “reactive typing” feature?


&gt;First, press the LED program button 1-2 times until you are in a mode where all keys are unlit. Then hold down the control key and touch the LED program again. To exit reactive typing mode, hold the control key and press the LED program key again.


&gt;3.) How do I save my LED Key pattern?


&gt;To create your own custom LED light settings, press and hold the LED program button until the red ring starts blinking (about 5 seconds). Press the keys you’d like to change to turn the individual LED on or off and then press and hold the LED program button again to save those settings. 



&gt;4.) How do I reset the keyboard lighting pattern to default?


&gt;Hold down the LED program button for 5 seconds. Pressing the brightness button will toggle between all lights on, all lights off, and programmed backlight pattern. This allows you to either start your programming with all lights on, off, or the last custom configuration for easy setup. 


&gt;5.) Is it possible to save multiple profiles?

"You might be interested in a mechanical keyboard since its an entirely different type of experience than a normal rubber dome/chicklet keyboard. If the 750ti is a hefty investment for you, a mechanical keyboard might not look good in your eyes, but you just have to try one in real life to see how it feels. Check out /r/MechanicalKeyboards to see more.

Also copy-pasting from a previous comment I've made:
&gt;If you've never tried a mechanical keyboard before, its not simply the ""click"", but the feel of the entire typing experience. You will *have* to try it out to know what I mean. There are many different types of key switches with different amounts of force required to register their presses, different ones that have a tactile bump that tell you when you've activated the key, ones with no bump at all, different ones that click when pressed down, combinations of these, and a lot more. Its good to be educated about the different types of key switches before finally investing into a mechanical keyboard, based off of your situation and preferences. Head to /r/MechanicalKeyboards if you want to see people with way too many keyboards and good recomendations. Personally, I'd recommend the Cooler Master Storm Quickfire series [here](http://www.amazon.com/CM-Storm-QuickFire-TK-Mechanical/dp/B00A378L10/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451646731&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cm+quickfire) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/Storm-QuickFire-Rapid-Tenkeyless-Mechanical/dp/B007VDKLLM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451646731&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cm+quickfire), or the popular Poker II from Massdrop. A good mechanical keyboard is definitely a worthy investment, as it will last you for a very long time and you can swap out the keycaps if they get damaged or if you want a different look. Also note that Razer's mech keyboards are lower quality than most other keyboards due to their special key switches manufactured in China, so don't trust Razer's keyboards no matter how flashy they look. You're better off with literally any other mechanical keyboard.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

He may have 24cores, but what does it matter if most games use 2-4, maybe even up to 8. My 4 cores at 4.6Ghz would absolutely crush his 24 &lt;3.2Ghz cores in game performance.

"Here's my best joke (worth the read):

Three friends, seeking great fortune, visit a newly discovered pyramid. Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""

"Well if it's overkill then we should still be using quad core duo's,
Even with my fx8350 @ 4.9ghz there are a couple of games that hover around 50fps at ultra with a screen resolution of 2560×1600p,

@ 1920×1080p yes it is slightly overkill at the moment but give it 6 months to a year new games will be pushing it to its limits,

But by then zen will be out and that will not be overkill either as more people would be upgrading to 1440p.

This is how the technology has been progressing every since I can remember,
Shortly after a company releases some new piece of hardware that destroys every game they will bring out a new game that pushes it to its limit.

The only way I could think buying any pc part as overkill is if you buy x fire or slightly as soon as a card is released,
Because by the time you use the full power of the second card it would have gone down in price,

But then you have to consider what screen resolution and refresh rate he is running,
Because If he is running 1920×1080p @60fps a dual card pc would be overkill but what if he's running 2k or 4k @ 144fps,
Then it would be a completely different story.",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

"It seems you are possibly discussing piracy or piracy-related topics. Although this is neither against reddit's rules nor our own, it's important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from you.

Piracy is an important freedom in our sometimes restrictive societies, and it's important to remember these things before you pass judgement on people discussing it:

* Some pirate games because they believe the creator [doesn't deserve financial compensation](http://i.imgur.com/FRaRenV.jpg) for the state of the product that was released.
* Some pirate something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM.
* Some pirate to re-obtain something they already bought.
* Some pirate to try products before they make a financial commitment to them.
* Some pirate simply because they cannot afford it.
* Some pirate to get something that's no longer available.
* Some pirate because their country censors or doesn't import it.
* Some pirate games because of timed exclusivity. If they don't have access to it yet, they use piracy as a method to access it before it's available to them.

Lastly, here's a few tips: AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) is an excellent open-source client that [isn't in close cooperation with the MPAA](http://libcom.org/forums/news/utorrent-bought-mpaa) (unlike uTorrent, **uninstall it as soon as possible**). Oh, and remember: torrenting in itself isn't illegal, and it's definitely not piracy! It's simply a method of transferring files. It's what you transfer that matters.

I just lack power (recording, streaming and gaming at the same time) with some games.

I have found, to be completely honest, that the vast majority of issues people have with computers (and I don't mean this offensively - it's just an observation) stem from the user doing something wrong.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer


Look - CUDA, OpenCL, DirectX, Mantle, OpenGL, CTM/Firestream and almost every single graphics driver in the history of the world has been designed as a fairly high level finite state machine with opaque references. This is why you need to bind things all the time to draw or in the new drivers, specify what you are modifying using an arbitrary reference passed to you by the driver.

Because Nvidia only has one driver that does everything and a unified HAL + API for use by their driver and because thru control CUDA, they can know the reference structure of a program by giving hints to their driver.

This is separate from PhysX working in isolation or not because if it detects the situation where no compatible GPU is found it can just switch to a GPU pathway.

There are many political reasons why we are in this situation where CUDA is disabled for AMD from both sides. In short:

- AMD thought CUDA is too specific to Nvidia's architecture and thought that they would have more influence by going their own way with CTM and Firestream. CTM came out months before CUDA. This is similar to why Mantle tech was never adopted until after it passed through a third party standards body that guarantees input from competitors. See http://www.extremetech.com/computing/82264-why-wont-ati-support-cuda-and-physx

- Dedicated PhysX cards are obsolete because the compute to graphics ratio has changed much to the favor of compute in the last few years and CPU acceleration via SIMD and vector extensions. The ratio trends are not exclusive to Nvidia. The Fury line for example have much same graphics resources as a 390X despite having much more GCN CUs. The use case for a dedicated driver has been encroached on from both ends. The cases where GPU acceleration actually speeds things up noticeably therefore is in he case where two cards can skip drivers and DMA each other (write directly to each other's memory without going through CPU) or don't need to do that because it's on the same card. Both situations are unworkable without AMD support which they are not interested in. See https://www.techpowerup.com/mobile/64787/radeon-physx-creator-nvidia-offered-to-help-us-expected-more-from-amd.html

- Dedicated PhysX GPUs are a bitch to support. They can often slow down a setup if the cards used are not the right balance which is a nightmare to deal with as a vendor. Try explaining why a user setting is being ignored if someone tries to pair a 980Ti or Fury X with a 660. See https://youtu.be/cbww3dhzK0M

In American football you don't need to touch it down you just need to be in control over the ball when you enter the endzone.

"Basically, brand recognition.  People buy NV because they don't even think about an alternative.  They see NV logos all over AAA game boxes and splash screens (because NV have effectively paid, either literally or in kind for them to be there), so that's what they have in mind.

Also, NV have been careful not to impair the experience *if* you're running entirely NV graphics hardware.  So there's an element of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt) involved too - do I *dare* to take the *risk* of buying AMD and *possibly* suffering the problems mentioned above?  Much *safer* to buy NV, then I *know* the big AAA games will work properly.

That's why.  I don't agree, but that's how many people think.

A few years ago, I myself built a machine based around a high-end Sandy Bridge and a GTX 580.  I did that because one particular game was badly CPU-limited on the Phenom II X4 and Radeon HD 5870 that I'd put together the previous year.  While it wasn't a AAA title, it did rely on PhysX, so I assumed that using an Nvidia card would allow it to be accelerated.  That was the major reason for buying NV over AMD/ATI at the time.

Not so.  Turns out rigid-body PhysX (which is what this game used) wasn't hardware-accelerated at all, even on a pure NV system.  Only the cloth, liquid and particle systems were, and this game didn't use any of those.  But the Sandy Bridge CPU did lift the CPU bottleneck enough to restore playability.

(I still think the Phenom II is a really good machine, but that game engine was ridiculously inefficient.  The publisher is presently in the middle of rewriting it.)",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

I have a similar opinion with Uplay and its fantastic game Child of Light, since it is very rare to get games like that from massive companies. Get more games like those released, and I might go there more often; otherwise, it is usually a convenience factor.

Then again, I wish Steam Support had much better service (EA was excellent when I had a particular problem; Steam...meh).

"Well. Let me tell you about my PC upgrade story, get comfortable.

Firstly, a little background on me is in order. I'm a software engineer, hardware is like rocket science to me, if it has LEDs on it then it's all too much.

Anyway, gaming on my now old PC was pretty awful, I mean, I could play games, but on minimal graphics and still had a low frame rate, I had no choice but to ascend.

So I went out to my local computer shop and brought myself a new GPU, a **GeForce GTX 750 Ti** (I have no idea whether it's good or not) and I also had to buy a new PSU in order to power it. I got home, happy with my purchase but somewhat daunted with how the hell I was going to install it. The PSU and GPU set me back £150.

So I opened up the case, pulled out the old PSU, remembering where everything was plugged in and put the new PSU in. On the motherboard, there was I think a 12 pin slot for power going in, but my PSU had a 20 pin connector, and I was like. ""Well, I can just put it in, it's only electricity, right?"". It turns out that it was a mistake to do that. I turned on the power, none of the fans turned on and I smelt a smelly smell, a smelly smell that smells smelly, the CPU burning up.

**""Shit.""**

So I went back to my local computer shop, had them take a look at the motherboard and the guy behind the counter was like **""Yep, you fucked it.""**. So he took me around the shop to find a new motherboard bundle, apparently they were on offer (He probably played me for a fool) but who cares, I was ascending, right? I brought myself a brand new motherboard and PSU bundle, another £150.

I got home, tore open the packaging, opened the case and almost immediately realised that I had made yet another massive error. The motherboard wouldn't fit in the case.

**""Fucking shit!""**

So at this point I decided enough is enough. Somebody stop the damn match. I went online (on my phone) and took the time to research what the fuck I just brought and I brought a case which was the correct size. Another £30.

The next day I waited patiently for the postman to turn up with my shiny new case, when it came I again, tore open the packaging and to my delight, this looked like this was it. This is the one. I finally have the tools I need to ascend to the master race.

I took my time installing everything, making sure all of the connections were correct and the power cables were in the right place and all that. I still managed to use the wrong screws but no matter, no matter, the time had come to turn this bitch on and see what she can do.

"It really depends on your career goals.  If you want to be a professor with your own research group, you must get that PhD and do the postdoc.  Also, if you want to move up and be well known in a renown chemical/research company, you may want the PhD and to do an industrial postdoc.  

However, if you just want a good job with a pretty good salary, the PhD is not necessary for industry.  In fact, you are correct, the jobs that require/hire PhD level education are few and limited.  And as a PhD, it is hard to get hired for bachelor's or masters's level positions.  Good companies do not want to be known as a place that hires PhDs but only pays them master's or bachelor's wage.  It is the over qualified conundrum.

As far as experience, no matter what you do in grad school, it will not be seen as equivalent to industry experience.   

So, my suggestion is this, if really want that MBA, see if you can get it while you finish the PhD.  But if your advisor will not let you do that, and you do not want the things I talked about in the first paragraph, get the masters now and move on.  While you are finishing up, learn all the instrumentation, software, and equipment use/repair that you can.  That is the most valuable experience for getting an industry job.  Also, to have a job lined up when you graduate, you need to start applying at least 6 months before you graduate.

"Most reasonable profs won't really expect anything. If you're working on a project with established chemistry (repeating a previous student's conditions exactly, making literature compounds, etc), then you should be making compounds in reasonable (though not necessarily outstanding) yields and be able to purify them. If you are working on really new chemistry, you probably won't produce much of anything, but you should be refining your skills, getting comfortable in the lab, learning new techniques, and you should be able to speak intelligently about what's going on (""reaction didn't work"" = starting material? decomposition? rearrangement? deprotections?).  
Don't feel too bad. Most people get shit all in their first 6 months. Use this time to soak up knowledge from older students/postdocs - even people outside your group (if they're friendly and willing). Pester them about your chemistry. Ask them questions about theirs. See if they have any ""tips"" - most experienced chemists have little tricks they use during workup that aren't mentioned in papers, books, or theses.

I'm sure that all those Brazilians with expensive, shitty GPUs are all very appreciative.

"Surprisingly, it isn't! It's a 1995 Toyota Corolla with a 1.5L engine. I'll grant that it's an old car, yet not old or rare enough to be anywhere near a classic. However, there's a surprisingly large number of Toyota Corollas from that generation on the roads in Ireland and the car's been by-and-large a lot more reliable than most of the other reasonable choices I'd have. Given that newer, electronic-heavy cars are much more expensive to get fixed and that I don't need nor desire ABS or traction control unless I'm buying a sports car or a bells-and-whistles entertainment system at any stage, it's suitable enough for my needs and has passed the NCT without any major concerns the last couple of years.

If I genuinely thought that a more modern saloon car or hatchback would have enough improvements to make it worth the expense, I'd buy a newer car.

"Asseto Corsa and Project Cars lean more towards realism. Grid and Dirt, on the other hand, are more like NFS. First two games are just typical realistic racing games. Dirt 3 focuses on rally and both Grids are like first two, but a bit more fun for beginners. I've tried all of them and I'd say simulators are not the way to begin. If you like off-road racing more go for Dirt. Otherwise It's between both Grids. First one is a bit better gameplay wise, but the second one is newer, somewhat better loking and cheaper. Project Cars is still really fun and good looking if you don't mind crashing and finishing last a whole bunch. So the choise is up to you.",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

"Driver hints are still hints. It's implicit behavior.

There's also a difference in philosophy between the two companies with respect to support though they are converging. Nvidia generally likes to limit support to explicitly tested scenarios like how it's only possible to SLI chips of the same chip and cut where AMD used to allow Crossfire between chips of different cuts. 

http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/sli/supported-gpus
http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Crossfire-Chart.aspx

It doesn't matter if can be hacked to work or not the problem is the cost of support and the right to self determination. It doesn't make sense for Nvidia to pick up the support bill for AMD if it's unprofitable just like it doesn't make sense for Microsoft to support PPC MIPS and Alpha even if it can be compiled and shipped relatively easily as we saw with Windows on ARM. Same way with support for WINE or ReactOS or any number of virtualization attempts and they did not do so until there came a business case for it as others were willing to foot the bill for the specific feature.

"Honestly, as CS:GO is right now I imagine it would be punishing to new players and here's why. First off let me state that I love cs:go, most played game on steam got fairly high up before I took it less seriously yadda yadda. The thing is that the ranks, as they stand are busy shifting massively, this is due to valve who curved the ranks toward Gold Nova Master (about the mid way rank in the game). Now what this has done is put a lot of higher ranked players in the lower brackets. For example I played a game not too long ago on my smurf which is gn4 and I got matched with deranked Legendary eagles and dmg's (both fairly high ish ranks in the game). Now what this means is that legitamte lower ranked players get put up against deranked higher rank players, often resulting in a complete stomp. And since gn4 is now the median rank, it's not hard to reach at all. In terms of competitive play it's fantastic and extremely fun and rewarding and before the rank shift I would have recommended it in a heart beat. But now i'd say maybe wait until the ranks settle more.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

And wanna know why some keys are reported as stolen? It happens when someone buys a boxed copy and tries to type in the key only to get an error saying ""key already in use"".

CDKeys are buying their keys from OTHER Greymarket stores such as G2A, Kinguin, Oneplay, etc. And those in return either buy it from other Greymarkets or ultra cheap regions, and those Greymarket got it by scanning a code from the boxed copy.

So you're actually worse than a pirate by buying from these sites, because not only aren't you paying the devs for their hard work, but you are buying from thieves who flatout stole the key.

"&gt;Driver hints are still hints. It's implicit behavior.

Please. There are no hints in the fact that it worked out of the box in their earlier drivers. The driver just never tried to limit this functionality in the first place because Nvidia never though people would try to combine GPUs of both vendors.

It was not a feature that first was implemented and then disabled. CUDA was able to work on a secondary device long before this. PhysX just didn't care to check anything about CUDA or GPU before Nvidia caught up on what's going on.

&gt;the problem is the cost of support

Sounds like Nvidia marketing team. It's been proven many times that this specific thing **does not need any support** to work properly with non-Nvidia card. Just because it happened to work does not mean that it could be considered a feature. It was working by design, the same way as it worked with Nvidia GPU. Nvidia found a way to block it. People asked them to not block it. Nvidia did not listen.

Just like several different GPUs can live together and output data onto different displays - it's not a feature that Nvidia or AMD supports. It can work out of the box because they don't need to look at each other before deciding on what to do. If this is a feature, then it's a feature of WDM/WDDM. Neither vendor should block this.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"In windowed mode, all that happens is that the frame displayed is handled by the WDDM driver. If the game's not drawn a new frame, Windows will automatically show the previous frame again until the new frame is ready. Therefore, you can't get tearing in windowed mode, but instead you get stuttering because what's happening is very close to v-sync.

G-sync and FreeSync both significantly improve this for windowed and fullscreen scenarios.

&gt; Also, Freesync can work on any GPU, Nvidia just needs to support it, and doesn't require an extra 200 dollars of proprietary hardware, since it's just an open standard.

First, it's not an extra 200 dollars, that was the upgrade kit which was made from an expensive FPGA and essentially a dev kit sold to the public. Furthermore, the additional hardware in the monitor enables G-sync to work with far more variable frame rates than FreeSync (G-sync doesn't have min/max frame rates, most FreeSync monitors do).

Nvidia came up with this first, then AMD played catch up and are ""releasing"" it as an open standard to try and paint Nvidia in a bad light. What AMD's doing (variable VBLANK) also isn't some kind of new technology - it's been supported by the standard for quite some time, it's just that nobody had thought to use it to adapt a monitor's refresh rate to the frame rate of what's being displayed. I think Nvidia would benefit from supporting Adaptive Sync, but I can totally see why they wouldn't want to (since G-sync is still a better technology and is exclusive to them, giving them an extra selling point).",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

So you would certainly feel some burning on your lip, which might persist for a few hours, depending on how much damage was done.

There's come configurations (SLI, or 1080p with a high-end card) when they bottleneck, but a lot of the time they're still virtually as good as anything else you can get.

"Okay, here. http://imgur.com/44WiHIw

I'd make a folder called ""Backup"" and move all the contents of your HDD to it, then create a folder to keep your games (I created ""Program Files (x86)"").  In steam, click Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Downloads -&gt; Steam Library Folders -&gt; Add New Folder -&gt; Pick the game folder you made.

Then you can find your old steamapps in the backup folder, copy it to the new folder you made through steam, restart steam, voila, games good to go (steam will run first time setup for any games that need it for you when you launch them).

For all the other things, I created a folder called ""Files"" and moved all my ""library"" folders from my new installation to that folder.  You do this by going to ""This PC""/""My Computer""/""Computer"" and right clicking the ""library"" and clicking properties, then location. Click move and select the Files folder.

I do this for all of the ""Libraries"" (some can be found under C:\Users\[Your username], like the Contacts and Links and stuff). 

After doing that, you can go into your BACKUP folder and then cut and paste the library folders to the same place, merging their contents.

You can scour your backup folder for other files that may be hiding, leave there just in case, or delete if you want space.

I do it this way so that when I reinstall windows, all I have to do is move those ""libraries"" in the windows settings and then reinstall steam/origin and point them to those directories and they're good to go, all files and games that were kept there. Origin games will still have to ""install"" but if you're installing them to the directory they were already in, it'll detect they're there and do ""first time setup"" equivalents. 

Edit:
I like to keep games that load a lot and that I mod a lot (like fallout) on the SSD steam library so they load faster, but before I reinstall windows I always move them to the other steam library temporarily.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

Developing for multiple platforms and architectures and vendor devices will violate you in ways you never thought possible. Just recently I discovered the magical world of floating point conversions and integer behavior differences between x86, automatic x86 extensions and ARM. Best part is that the behavior changes depending on compiler/optimization level because half this stuff is undefined behavior in C/C++.

Graphics drivers are fucking notorious for off spec behavior. That's actually why AMD's drivers aren't as good ad Nvidia's - they don't bend over backwards as much to accommodate stupid application behavior. PhysX and CUDA are open standards anybody can implement just like OpenCL and DirectX and just like those, support is the responsibility of the vendor. 

In any case none of this really matters because GPU accelerated PhysX is mostly an anachronism now because most if it can be done with core features of platform agnostic APIs like DX/OGL/VK now.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

Code 3:  15-23-16 **TAKEN**

EDIT: GIVEAWAY OVER [This is the code I used, codes 2 and 3 should be broken with the resitor color code and all three with this one.](http://www.syntaxcomm.com/colorcodes.html)

There are 13,800 possible combinations so if you try to randomly redeem on Steam without breaking the color code you'll be locked out of the redemption page.

Once you break the code you can redeem all of the codes or just one or two to give others a chance. That is up to you. If you redeem a code post a screen cap.

Your first clue is:

Resistance is futile.

EDIT 1: Seriously, resistance is futile. [Meaning this.](https://www.google.com/search?q=resisto+code&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=resistor+code)

Edit 2

Second clue: Numbers 1-25 are represented in the color code.

**I will be back in about 30 minutes to add another clue if no-one has gotten it. That will be around 10:30 PST**

Edit 3

Third clue:http://www.icc.com/t/faq

I'll edit this post to add more clues until the codes are claimed.",pcmasterrace,5,1200.0

"That's awesome that you found a good balance between gaming and a life outside of gaming!  So many young people have trouble with doing things in moderation, whether it's gaming, socializing, partying, studying, or something else.

P.S.  Since you're preparing for college, I'm going to have to point out that your usage of ""you're"" is in correct.  ""You're"" = you are.  

Other common grammatical errors (most people make):  
it's = contraction of ""it is""  (e.g. it's (it is) nice to see grandma on the weekends)  
its = possessive form of ""it""  (e.g. its color is red)  

let's = contraction of ""let us"" (e.g. let's go watch a movie)  
lets = allow (e.g. my mom lets me watch TV for 2 hours/day)  

th**e**n = used in stringing together **e**vents (e.g. first, I woke up; then I changed out of my PJs)  
than = used in comparisons (e.g. my rig is slower than yours)  

affect = a verb (e.g. the song affected me greatly)  
effect = a noun (e.g. the song had a great effect on me)  

lose = a verb (e.g. you lose)  
loose = an adjective (e.g.  the screw is loose)  

peek = a verb (e.g. I'm going to take a peek at the notes)  
peak = a noun (e.g. that mountain has a very tall peak)  
pique = a verb (e.g. the lecture piqued my interest on the subject)  

me vs I -- use ""me"" when it's the object of the sentence (e.g. give the candy to John and me);  use ""I"" when it's in the subject (e.g. John and I went to the concert)  

who vs that - use ""who"" when describing a person (e.g. she's the one who always yells; use ""that"" when describing an object (e.g. his PC is the one that is always overheating)  

less vs fewer - use ""less"" when it's a partial quantity (e.g. the flowers need less water in the winter); use ""fewer"" when the quantity is whole pieces (e.g. fewer people came to the party this year than last year)  

Knowing the items on this list will put you ahead of most people when it comes to writing skills.  

I work as an IT manager.  If I see more than 2 mistakes from the list above on a cover letter, I just toss the resume into the trash without even reading it.  I don't care if they have 20 years of IT experience working in nearly all IT areas.  

On the rare occasion that I do decide to give them a second chance, I use the ""need clarification"" as an excuse to write them an email using the same words they used, only corrected.  The smart ones pick up on this and reply with a way to correctly use the same words--demonstrating that they have the ability to focus on details while being able to adjust on-the-fly.

He is right about the usual acronyms, but the way he argues for this word not being an exception would apply to every single one of those. If that argument would be right, it would be ""jirl"" because how stupid is it for that word to be in that 0.5%? However, he still has remaining arguments while I don't at the moment. ""Gi"" in English is still more likely to be pronounced like ""ji"", but as he said, acronyms are their own word. They can be exceptions themselves like other words and there are not much things determining an exception than its usage. A lot of people still pronounce it with a hard G, just like they do with ""gear"". It's not standardized at all, arguments are all over the internet, we are not ready to explicitly say one side is wrong and the other is right.

The fact is that it's benchmarks do actually translate into real world performance, it's a great indicator. Too much shit is said about synthetics when they're normally better than real games, because real games these days are full of performance issues and stupid shit like gameworks. 

And I know about minimum and maximum FPS, this is a big issue in games like Far Cry 3 and games running on CPUs with 2 threads, but the raw performance I find is more accurate from synthetics than everything else.

"So? The only argument you are making is that ""gif"" has a hard g is that it COULD be an exception. But, the question here is, why make it an exception? As stated in the video, only 0.5% of G followed by I, U, or Y contains a hard g. So why would you add ""gif"" to the list, when you could follow the laws of the English language? All of this argument is also ignoring the two most damning points, which are -

1) The creator himself says that ""gif"" is pronounced ""jif"". I have never seen anyone counter this point - all they say is that the creator is wrong, but how could he be wrong?

2) The ""Jraphics"" argument, which was proven wrong in the video. If you say Gif with a hard g, then you better pronounce JPEG, LASER, SCUBA, and many others differently too.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Corsairs SPs make for pretty shitty case fans, they have terrible airflow and only mediocre static pressure.

The non quiet edition ones are also FAR too loud for case fans.

The AFs have dreadful static pressure and only average airflow, wouldn't recommend Corsair fans at all.

Far higher performing at 150RPM less. Static pressure 2.61 mm/H20 (almost double, easily makes up for the tiny loss of peak airflow and will actually have miles more than the Corsair).

Edit 2: Moved the edits to the top because apparently some people here are to stupid to read comments in their entirety before voting on it. Downvote me all you like for saying that if you're the type of person who downvotes people who complain about downvotes. Fact is that there are way to many idiots who vote without even reading the entire comment they are voting on. And while I don't care about the downvotes, I definitely do care that people like them are ruining reddit by abusing the vote buttons.

p.s. My apologies for going on a rant here. It's just very upsetting when there are assholes who downvote comments when they are to lazy to even read them. Those are the type of assholes who are ruining reddit for everyone else.

The American goes first. He builds a high-tech shield from depleted uranium and composites, and hides behind it. The Devil strikes once - the shield cracks; twice - the shield falls apart; thrice - the American is no more.

Next goes the Indian. He puts himself in some advanced Yoga position and goes into deep hibernation. The Devil strikes once - nothing; twice - the Indian shivers a bit; thrice - the Indian grunts, but lives. The Devil is amazed and tells him he's free to go. The Indian asks ""May I stay and watch?

"I use very little at 1080p, and I do know that is one of the things a higher resolution can do (higher resolution = less aliasing even without AA). The thing is, I can't tell the difference between 1080P with 2X AA and the higher resolutions with the same AA. At 1080P with 2X AA (specifically FXAA, which is what I usually use), I can only notice jaggies if I put my face super close to the screen.

I imagine, though, I might be able to run games at 4K (assuming I could actually run them at that resolution without destroying performance) with no AA at all and still not notice jaggies. The only reason I use 2X AA now is that I don't see a difference going higher except in the performance dip. I like to adjust my settings until I get to a point where I can't *see* the changes, but I can still *feel* them... If that makes sense.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Why do you need LEDs? If you want LEDs buy LED strips, don't buy crappy fans just because they light up. You can't even turn the LEDs off so if you ever change build you're stuck with them, whereas Noctuas you aren't.

Yeah, the Noctua costs more, that's because it performs 1.5x better than the Corsair fans while being miles quieter. They also have a 6 year warranty and beat the Corsairs in every area.

Noctua have a Redux product line with the S12B, that would also beat the Corsairs for airflow fans.

You either pay half and buy something far worse that last nowhere near as long while performing worse, or buy once and get a product with a huge lifespan that is actually engineered to be good by a company that knows only two things - fans and heatsinks.

The small price premium is nothing compared with the quality increase. Corsairs fans flex, they have no anti vibration mounts on the LED ones (an the non LED anti vibration mounts fall apart), they have poor performance and they're loud. Just no point to buying a fan that performs like 60% as well as another fan, you could practically buy 1 Noctua and have it outperform the Corsair in some cases, for instance one NF F12 should be pretty close to beating two Corsair SP120s in performance and it would be so much quieter. 

Come next build, the Noctuas will still be performing perfectly and still in warranty, the Corsairs will be becoming noisy, well out of warranty and do you really still want LED fans? It's one of those things you buy once, then regret not just buying a better fan that you could use elsewhere later too or when you change your builds colours you end up stuck with a fan that doesn't match.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Well as I said, 2 Noctua is like buying 3 Corsair and it would be quieter by far too. And it's not £50 either, two NF F12 = £30, one S12A = £15

And you wouldn't need to control the Noctuas anyway they'd already be quiet as hell. All you need is 3 Noctuas and then just use their included low noise adapters on each. A Noctua on an LNA is silent, yet it will still be rivaling / outperforming a Corsair fan when that's making multiple x more noise.

&gt;but neither allow the fans to drop lower than %40 which I still believe will be fairly audible (Would like the case to be as quiet as possible when not under load)

That's because fans can't operate below 40% speed, they just turn off. You for sure wouldn't hear a Noctua on that speed at all, a Corsair... probably. They'd both be quiet at 40% though, that is REALLY low. 

Noctuas won't start making that much noise even at 100%.

If you're looking for a quiet PC, Noctua is what you should buy. Corsair won't be quiet at all, on Noctua's 80% speed using a low noise adapter it will be quieter than the Corsair on like 50-60% speed, the noise to performance ratio is so superior.

If you buy a Noctua, then there is no need for any fan hub or anything like that, so in the end you actually pay less, and get far higher quality components. 

Remember the stats I posted

A mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper of 20 years, Guido, has cheated him out of $10 million. Guido is deaf which is why he got the job in the first place. The Godfather assumed that since Guido could not hear anything, he could never testify in court.When the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his personal lawyer because he knows sign language.

The Godfather tells the lawyer, ""Ask him where the money is!""

The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, ""Where's the money?""

Guido signs back, ""I don't know what you are talking about."" The lawyer tells the Godfather, ""He says he doesn't know what you are talking about.""

The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's head and says, ""Ask him again or I'll kill him!""

The lawyer signs to Guido, ""He'll kill you if you don't tell him."" Guido trembles and signs back, ""OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno's house.""

The Godfather asks the lawyer, ""What did he say?""

Or how many hour sessions do you think is necessary before they'll be good drivers?

Logging everything your child is doing is fine if you deem it necessary. A parent/child relationship here, not some random person off the internet logging shit on some other random persons PC. Another point I thought would be obvious. 

Your TLDR should have been; I somehow thought GTA being an 18 was voiding the argument when in reality was the very point of said argument. Then I talked some nonsense about teaching road safety badly. I want to ignore the fact we're talking about parenting.

The PSU is a crapfest yeah, the old TR2 wasn't good at all.

There are no ""reliable brands"" of PSU really except SeaSonic and Super Flower (and Delta but those are mostly OEM). This is because they build their own PSUs are they are always really reliable, and they sell far more under their own name than other OEMs like CWT.

Companies like Corsair and EVGA for example don't build them, instead they are made by others like SeaSonic and Super Flower, but branded as a Corsair. But this means there can also far worse OEMs inside Corsair PSUs and EVGA PSUs, or at least far worse models from fairly reputable OEMs these days like FSP.

SeaSonic are one of the few who build and sell their PSUs under their own name in big quantities, most others like CWT just sell them to Corsair etc.

So pretty much if you want to be certain, SeaSonic is the most trusted brand. XFX is too, as they are 100% SeaSonic built.

Super Flower is equally as trust worthy, as are the new FSPs coming out like the EVGA GQ and FSP's own Hydro series.

For cooler, an NH D15 would be best if it fits in a 200R. If it doesn't then you could go with something like an Corsair H100i GTX.

"Alright, I've looked at some benchmarks. From what I've seen, the GTX 970 is currently has the best price/performance ratio of Nvidia's cards. I actually ordered one this week because I wanted to get a graphics card that wouldn't show its age too quickly. I would've bought an R9 390 but it would come close to exceeding my PSU's 500W limit and I didn't want to run into any power issues.

There was that issue where the last 512MB of VRAM performed pretty slowly in the 970, although at 1080p Fallout 4 doesn't seem to exceed 3GB so it shouldn't make much of a difference.

[Fallout 4 benchmark at 1080p ultra settings.](http://media.gamersnexus.net/images/media/2015/game-bench/fallout-4-gpu-bench-1080-ultra.png) The 970 performs pretty damn well, it's almost indistinguishable from the 980. It also outperforms the R9 390X and is more consistent with its framerates. The 960 manages to pull in a 53FPS average (also impressive) but can hit 40FPS in some of the more detailed areas in the game.

[Fallout 4 at 1080p medium settings.](http://media.gamersnexus.net/images/media/2015/game-bench/fallout-4-gpu-bench-1080-medium.png) You can expect to pull in 60FPS at medium settings if you go for the 960, you'll very very rarely go below 55FPS.

They're using a pretty high end i7 for the CPU so you should expect to get lower frames than those mentioned above. From what they show, AMD's cards are more inconsistent with their frame rate unfortunately.

The 970 is definitely more future-proof than the 960 and will last you longer, and will let you play Fallout 4 on ultra/high settings but whether or not you spend the ~$320 for one is your decision. 960s are around $190 from what I'm seeing. The R9 390X costs around $80-100 more than the 970 yet it performs at a lower and less consistent frame rate in Fallout 4, so I can only imagine that the R9 390 (~$300) would perform even worse. It's your decision whether running Fallout 4 at higher settings plus having the ability to rely on your card for a while is worth the extra money.

"Hi,
if you want top, but expensive chair you should go for Steelcase (http://www.amazon.com/Steelcase-Leap-Fabric-Chair-Black/dp/B006H1QYBA) or Herman Miller (http://www.amazon.com/Aeron-Task-Chair-Herman-Miller/dp/B0014YGGKE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451676984&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=herman+miller). Its really expensive for chair, but you dont need to buy new chair ever again.

If you want something cheaper Ikea Markus is fairly popular and not bad especially for the money (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60309732/#/70261145).
The middle ground in my opinion would be some ergonomic chair from brand like Office Pro (or your regional equivalent) - for this your best shot is just go to the chair store, try chairs in your price range, sit, lean and test and than take your favourite.
 Personally, Im not fan of ""gaming chairs"" I think you can get better chair in same price range, when you go for office or ergonomic chair.

"980TI and Corsair CX is a mismatch. 

And...

http://i.imgur.com/gPfEW84.jpg

what's going on here? You don't need to use the molex adapters... your PSU already has PCIE connectors, the molex to pcie adapters are flat out dangerous too they are known for blowing up shit just like they blow up hard drives when it's molex to sata.

You're adapting to a connector your PSU already has several of, it's illogical. Take them off and use the PCIE connectors from your PSU.

And thirdly you have a H170 board... so that CPU can't be oced, yet you have a twin tower cooler on it which seems pretty pointless honestly. And the fans are backwards, it's meant to exhaust out the back not into the case.

And the lack of exhaust fan is pretty odd too.

http://i.imgur.com/ZEdREAP.jpg

this is how the airflow should be, front fans intaking heading towards the cpu fans which exhaust out the back with an exhaust fan on the back of the case.

"Specs: 

* AsRock 880G Pro3 (ATX AM3+ mobo)
* AMD Phenom II X4 965 (@ 3.7GHz OC)
* Alpenföhn Himalaya
* 12GB dual channel DDR3-1333 (@ 1600Mhz CL9)
* MSI GTX560Ti Twin Frozr II OC
* Xilence XP1000 Rev3
* HGST 7K1000 (1TB, 7200rpm, 2.5"" HDD; mostly for benching though)
* Phanteks Enthoo Pro M
* Bitfenix alchemy white cable mods

and I might add one 30cm strip of Bitfenix Alchemy 2.0 blue LEDs at the bottom to get some blue glow from below in the case. 

And with those specs and the custom OC, the system is actually still pretty usable today, plays BF4 at 1080p Medium very smoothly and will only struggle with really demanding new games.

Now the coolest thing about it:
It was so hella cheap. There's different ways to calculate the cost:
100€ initial ebay cost. If you subtract the funds I got from selling the unused parts, you end up with some maybe 50€ for the core parts.
Now the case and cable mods I chose run about 115€, so we'd get a total of 165€. However, you could get away with way less, since usable cases start around 25€ and those would likely be way more suited for the hardware tier, then add in some 20-30€ for a HDD.

Which is why overall, I'm calling it the Hefty Hundred. 
A gaming PC that still packs some punch, and is a full system for roughly 100€. 

Granted, it would very likely cost more in general, since this was just a really good deal you won't be finding at every corner. But it shows that if you check local listings every now and then, you can build a gaming rig with a really tight budget.

**tl;dr: PC with PII 965, 12GB DDR3, 560Ti OC, more -&gt; all for around 100€.**




PS: I also tried using an old 9800GT as a PhysX card, just for giggles. Sadly, the 560Ti drivers are too new for the 9800GT. So if anyone knows how to get that working as a dedicated PhysX card without downgrading my drivers, would be appreciated.

"1) Learn to survive in a lab without butting heads with people and without injuring yourself or others.

2) Learn the techniques you'll need for the rest of your grad career, and get skilled at them (purification, air-free handling, interpreting spectra).

3) Show an intense curiosity in your work; constantly be reading related papers in any down time that exists.

4) Pick one or two tasks that the group in general has to do (refill solvents, keep up with order receipts, do safety inspections, inventory, be 'that guy' for cyclic voltammetry, etc) and volunteer to do it for the group.  Don't let it impinge on your research time, but contribute something valuable to the team that makes everyone's life easier.  

5) Show an intense - no, darn near heroic - effort to make progress on your research.  Document everything - photos of reactions in progress, clear and concise notebook entries, spectra of everything.  In my experience nothing frustrates a PI more than him/her asking ""What did you find out?"" and being told ""The reaction didn't work..."".  What do you mean it didn't work? Did you get back all starting materials with nothing changed?  Did it turn jet black and all decompose?  Did you make some side product?  Show me pictures or drawings of TLC aliquots, show me 1H NMRs from the crude mixture, show me spectra of all your column fractions.  Have an answer for why a reaction didn't work, and search the literature (SciFinder helps here) to find alternate routes which might work.

6) Make friends.  The head of the NMR department is your buddy.  So is the MS team, so are any post-docs in the group that you can get knowledge from.  Don't be known as the guy who never talks to anyone and never cultivates relationships or shows up to departmental seminars.

7) Chase down anomalies.  Get a weird result from a reaction?  Have a more experienced group member check your setup and read your notes (bribe them with pizza).  Still getting a weird result?  Analyze the heck out of it.  I did this at the end of my first year with a tiny peak in a mass spectrum that I didn't understand, and it led to 2 years worth of thesis work, a brand new catalyst system, and multiple papers.

what CPU actually is that? Is it a locked i7?

You should be able to simply unclip the fans on the cpu and put one on the side near the ram to exhaust backwards, and the other to again exhaust backwards to the back of the case.

I'd advise some kind of exhaust fan to be put there, it's the most essential fan imo. Do you have a fan on the top? I couldn't really tell in the picture, but if you do use it as exhaust instead.

"AMD's single core performance is very much a lot more worse than Intel's. I would know I've owned the same 8320 as you own. 

There were certain parts in games where my framerate would drop from 60fps to 30fps at any overclock speed. You can test this out with Skyrim. As soon as you walk past the gate with the two guards in Whiterun the framerate will drop significantly. As soon as I upgraded to my current INTEL CPU I tested this area. The frame rate did not drop at all.

Another game where AMD's performance would dip is GTA Online. Overclocking did help a lot, but the minimum framerates were still dipping below 60fps. Where as with my new Intel CPU the minimum framerate doesn't dip below 60fps at all.

Overclocking does help AMD's CPUs significantly but not close enough to Intel's stock speed and performance.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"That last remark is untrue, PCIe 2.0's maximum per lane speed is 500 MB/s while PCIe 3.0's maximum per lane speed is 985 MB/s, now lets do the math
    500 MB/s * 16 lanes = 8000 MB/s
    985 MB/s * 16 lanes = 15,760 MB/s
    ∴ As you can see the speed is practically doubled in PCIe 3.0 when compared to PCIe 2.0.
In terms of graphics cards you would start to notice a bottleneck when GPUs start to require more bandwidth than that iteration of PCIe can offer, but as it currently stands you should be just fine considering the 980 TI only has a memory clock of of 7000 MB/s which can be run on PCIe 2.0 without any issues.

"What sort of games are you into? If you're into FPS, CS:GO is probably a good bet. It's around $5.99, and the original Counter Strike is much cheaper. Obviously there's a huge gap in graphics quality between the two, but sometimes it's good to get a feel of the game's origin. That's kind of why I played Half Life before even touching Half Life 2... speaking of half life, you can buy a shit ton of  spin offs (like Half Life: Blue Coast etc.) for literally less than a dollar. You can also get the entire Bioshock trilogy for under $5, so they're a must if you like shooters. The narrative is also awesome, so there's story alongside shooting funtimes.  


There are also a load of Star Wars, lego-type games out on sale right now, so go for them if you're a fan. Fallout 4 is discounted by about $10, but I'm still biding my time.

A cup would be made out of solid antimony metal, and wine would be left in the cup overnight. The purpose was to induce vomiting the morning after a heavy drinking session. Enough antimony would dissolve in the wine to cause more or less immediate vomiting when drunk in the morning.

So if the emetic effects of antimony can be rapid, it is certainly possible that the constipation-curing (or diarrhea inducing, depending on perspective) could be similarly fast-acting.

If you then load a sample by mass, I'm not seeing how it would matter.  You have a ppm in headspace vs area under the curve calibration chart.  Just measure the area under the curve and you'll get the ppm of the VOCs above your sample.

"A bit of a conter point to the poster.

Gif is pronounced Gif because generally in the English language when we create acronyms, we use the common and standard phonetic default of the leter it represents, and we don't change it so it doesn't create confusion.
Source: US Military, and DoD.

Eg when you use the ""Laser"" Arguement, the defaulting representation of A is not ""ah"" it's ""AE"". ""Lay""ser.
Most NATO and US Military, DoD, and Government Acronyms fallow this representation behavior.
EG, NATO, En, AE, T(standard phonetic), Oh. Nah Toh? Or NAY to? NayTO.
OPEC? Oh, P(standard phonetic), Eh(default phonetic),C(standard phonetic).
Variations on this rule is utilized when someone can place a standard phonetic that appeals to the general public.
EG NASA, Is spoken ""Nah Suh.""
The general public has overwhelmingly said Gif, not Jif over the years, and only recently has the word been attempted to be changed by many people.

Whether the items from the inventories of the first testers of the client will remain after our repairs is still unknown. This is why we are refunding the full price to users accounts and we are offering one of the *following forms of compensation*. We can either return the money to your account or we can transfer the funds to your 4game account and you can use it for other benefits.

We, together with 343 Industries, deeply apologize to all the players of Halo Online, and especially to those who helped us in the testing and development/expansion of the project. We hope that when we open again, you'll be there with us!

I guess my point is that if I pay 60 bucks for a game on my (fairly burly) PC, I want to be able to remap the frickin' ""FORWARD"" command to the UpArrow on the keypad. If I want to remap the game's ""E"" command to the number-pad's ""./Del"" key, by god, I should be able to do that. Ubisoft and Bethesda are now on my naughty list.

CPU: If you choose not to overclock then the i5-6500 will be just fine for you
CPU Cooler: Since no stock cooler is included I chose to go for the best price to performance cooler which is the cryorig H7
Motherboard: Provides all the features you should need without the added price of the ability to overclock which would be useless to you, also it goes with your color scheme
Memory: Pretty much the same as before except at a slightly slower speed since you won't see any difference in performance unless you choose to use integrated graphics.
Storage: A 250 GB SSD is currently where you'll get the most for your money, a HDD of at least 1 TB should be included for excess media
GPU: The r9 390 tends to have an edge in FPS when against the 970 along with the fact that it has 8GB of VRAM compared to 3.5 + 0.5 and that it is cheaper, usually by 20-30 dollars. However if you'd like a 970 it's still a great card.
Case: A good home for your components, not much more to say. However if your curious there are other cases at the same price point such as the define r5
Power Supply: A tier 1 from a reputable company, you can be sure this will provide good, clean power to your parts and will allow you to overclock your GPU if you choose to.

Hope I've been able to help you! :D

Sure, an APU might run the top end games with awesome graphics and a good frame rate in the near ish future, but you wanna up the resolution? VR it? Dedicated cards will, for the foreseeable future, be the choice for the cutting edge of tech. Most likely change to it is probably HBM taking over, removing RAM slots.

"Dont even need a link! (it was on newegg, Ill just post it in this comment) not the most impressive review ive ever done (I do Android reviews and...once I did a *Cough* Porn Review *Cough* Which can be found in my reddit posting history lol)

&gt; Pros: Excellent Colors, Truly colors unlike any other motherboard I have seen, it goes perfectly with my case and RAM. 

&gt;Support for SLI, this is important for my GPUs and the Steel Reinforced PCIE Slots are a huge helper for the quite heavy pair of 960's I have. 

&gt;DDR4 Boost! Easy to use XMP profiles and the UEFI works perfectly, great for overclocking the CPU and RAM and toying with the voltages to get the perfect overclock!

&gt;Sound Boost: Everything sounds great! I play CS:GO Competitively and I can always hear the footsteps, no issues with sound at all! 

&gt;Options: Lots of options for expanding, with PCI slots, PCIE slots, Many SATA ports, and a just a ton of USB ports, I am currently using the USB 3.1 Gen 2 slots for my keyboard and mouse!

&gt;Cons: None at all! A truly great motherboard!

A barber is cutting a man's hair when a boy walks in. The barber chortles and tells the boy to come to him and tells the man, ""Look here, this is the stupidest boy in the world."" He held out in one hand a quarter and in the other a dollar. ""Here, pick whichever one you want."" The boy takes the quarter and leaves. ""What did I tell you?' he says to the man, ""Stupidest boy in the world."" As the man leaves, he sees the boy sitting on the stairs. Curious about the boys decision, he asks him, ""Why did you choose the quarter over the dollar? Clearly, the dollar is worth more."" The boy looks up and slowly smiles.

I've tried making a program I can communicate to and from with audio. It's fucking hard,  when it does work it takes time too because it has to search for words and put them in a sentence and then see which one makes the most sense before turning it into audio.

I wanted to avoid having a single voice say every word cause what if I forget to include a word. I had it create it off the noises the word makes
 So it can read a word and turn it into the different noises before outputting it.

"Yeah, to the extent of crysis2 tessellation I stand corrected (will edit post in a sec, so me admitting that is not buried).

At the same time I remain convinced that due to it's closed nature Gameworks does work against AMD.
It might be just because Nvidia cards are different and optimizing for them does not help (and may hurt) performance on AMD. 

It's also entirely possible there might have been zero-gain ""optimizations"" for Nvidia that hurt AMD, like excessive tessellation in hairworks, that has been somewhat proven to offer little to no improvement visually but significantly hurts performance of AMD. I'm taking the word proven here with with more than a grain of salt as the ones proving were AMD employees and I don't put it beyond them to cherry pick situations where there was no visual difference.

Once thing is clear: there is no clear and undeniable proof of Nvidia going beyond not giving AMD an option to optimize Gameworks (because it's closed). If they could prove Nvidia actively sabotaged their performance Nvidia would have lost in court and started paying before they could say ""unfair business practices"".",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"You're delusional, and this article is total clickbait when it's obvious the type of device this is. It's a set top box that is competing with Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, etc. Christ, look at the *exact* quote in the article:

&gt;The system, he says, would be “a lightweight Xbox One that may only be for Windows store games and would **compete with Apple TV**.” 

This market has already been established, and it is not remotely mysterious. I don't suppose you've ever used an Xbox One if you haven't realized that [the software has a lot of multimedia capability](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/entertainment); in fact, if you remember, the original criticism was the Xbox One focused too much on multimedia and not enough on gaming.

By the way, both the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/tv/games-and-more/) and [Amazon Fire TV](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Gaming-Edition/dp/B00XNQECFM) promote gaming capabilities. 

Additionally, this may be a good sign. Microsoft may be realizing they should focus more on Windows gaming rather than Xbox gaming and transition the Xbox brand entirely to multimedia.

You will discover your self if and at what clock speeds it needs more vcore.
The normal process involves increasing the multiplier till it's not stable,  increasing teh vcore very slightly till it is again, rinse repeat till temps /stability are intolerable.

It helps to Google discussions on overclocking your particular CPU and it's typical clock speed range and vcore usage so you have a point of reference. ( but! all chips are different don't take the info as something you can follow religiously)

Also in the end when you know your necessary load vcore, use adaptive offset vcore.

"&gt; 3D/PhysX (just like AMD/Nvidia) are not different platforms. Those are independent environments that can and do work together, simultaneously. PhysX integrator will not care about underlying architecture of current GPU. Like with any other physics engine, PhysX device is a calculation machine that does not care about models, textures, lights, shaders etc.

and it is the job of the vendor to implement and maintain

&gt; It's the other way around, you probably misinterpreted something about those. None of those are open. If you see some github repo by Nvidia or some archive from their dev-zone, make sure to read all the EULAs before making conclusions.

You're conflating open vs free - and there's two versions of free and also the SDK EULAs and the actual standard and tools.

Open standard just means anybody can licence it or use it and implement it. Cuda is open because AMD can pull shit like project Boltzmann and fork it. NVCC is also open source under GPLV2 and tracked by LLVM upstream.

OpenGL in particular is fairly patent encumbered at points and you can get sued by SGI and a few other companies if you don't licence and DirectX is straight up proprietary and locked unless MS grants access.

This is also similar to how Android is an open platform, standard and source despite the name being trademarked, the code somewhat patent encumbered and project fully controlled by Google, and the end distribution/SDK coming with a bunch of the same EULAs though I think in that case you agree to a bunch of them individually.

"For the more mainstream CPUs(i3, i5, i7) it works somewhat like this:

The i3/i5/i7 designates which family it is part of, and what features you can expect. 
i3 is kind of a mixed bag, but it is usually the cheapest, and usually a hyper threaded dual core.

i5 is usually a quad core on the desktop.

i7 is usually a hyper threaded processor, the core count varies.

the first number in something like the i7 5820k, indicates the generation, the 5820k would be considered a 5th gen processor. 

the next three numbers usually indicate how the specific model, with higher being better for the most part. It should be noted that second numbers up to 7 are part of the consumer platform, and the higher sku's such as the 820k, 930k, and the 960x and part of the enthusiast platform, and usually do not feature an intergrated gpu.

basically with gpu overclocking its:

1. set clocks, apply voltage accordingly

2. benchmark(some people do stress tests like furmark, I personally prefer more realistic tests through Unigine/3dmark)

3. a. run for a few passes, take note of temperature, if temperature is too high abort benchmark

The only other thing to add is to tailor your resume for the job description.  Make it painfully obvious that you're qualified and more.

"It's almost always better to build a PC, however I have seen in some countries because of awkward shipping and not a lot of tech parts get expensive and prebuilts can be cheaper. 

Also in some cases prebuilts are just plain cheaper, A bunch of my friend have been picking up this i7 4790k 16gb ddr3, 1tb rig at bestbuy for $500, then shoving in a new psu and gpu usually saving money. 

Building a pc is pretty easy, we can link videos you can practically follow along with. 

My biggest gripe with laptops is because of lack of cooling you usually get a very underclocked cpu and gpu getting a lot less performance than you could anyways. While a desktop even with a sub-par case, the cooling will be better. Not to mention the lack of upgradibility. Buyers remorse is a lot less on a PC, because if you don't like the boot speed, $30-50 and you can buy an ssd and have it boot instantly. It's too hot for you? Buy a different case or different fans/coolers. And you can always sell your old parts.  

As for ds? It depends what you will do with it. I love Fire Emblem so I am planning on picking up a 2ds for like $60 so I can play awakening and the new one coming out.

While if you upgrade to a 970, you get a good FPS gain, but your card won't be at its full potential. However you would need to look out for games that don't support dual cores as games are starting to not support it. So in essence, both upgrades will be good. It depends if you want to run newer games at all, or having higher graphical fidelity on games you currently can run with an i3.

I was looking at getting a 750ti a year ago. I then decided to wait and go for either an r9 280 or gtx 960. Ended up with the r9 280 because power usage didn't bother me and the 960 was considerably more money. Waiting and upgrading to one of these cards will allow you to play games at a better performance and still be quite affordable when compared to 950/r9370/750ti. The 750ti is also a bit old now so it may not be able to adopt new features in the future,pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"It could be either part honestly. Just a couple other questions to help troubleshoot the issue further. 

* Does the fan in the PSU spin?

* Do any other case fans/ CPU fan spin?

* With a monitor plugged in, does the machine POST? (i'm guessing not, but it's worth asking anyway)

Lastly to avoid potentially damaging anything, I would remove the PSU from the system and test it first. Until you're certain that the PSU isn't the issue I would be cautious.

1. first you pick a core clock speed as a target

4. If no crash, run a few passes just to see if its stable

"so, just a thought, what if Valve is using this sale as an ARG for the next game in the HL series, and in order to complete the ARG we need to spend enough money as a community to unlock HTML5, or javascript, or w/e the steam store is programmed in, which in turn starts a countdown timer to an announcement of the next part of the ARG which continues on in the spring sale, and when we spend enough money in the spring sale, we'll be given a code to input in on the steam store website like a few days ago, and this code unlocks the next part of the ARG which needs a specific set of cards only obtainable in the summer sale, and here's the kicker, in order to unlock the next part of the ARG, we don't actually spend money in the Summer Sale, we have to play w/e game they have running on the steam store, and when enough people have the high score in this game, then it unlocks a code for a discount on a game, but that game is in early access, idk what game it would be, probably gaben simulator, and when enough people have purchased this game using the discount, it starts a countdown timer for the next part of the ARG which runs in the fall sale, this one is pretty simple, just spend money on the sale, unlock a piece of the javascript code that starts another countdown to the winter sale, but when the winter sale starts next year, there will be a letter/number unlocked on the main steam ""featured items"" page every day until the sale ends, and when all the letters/numbers are there, you input it into the steam search, and it brings up one thing, absolutely one fucking thing, Rocochet 2...I'll let you decide what it means from there...O_O

"wow is free up to level 20.  so its always worth giving it a go see if you like it.  It really is my go to MMO for many years now, some reason i cant keep away. I've actually only just re subbed.  the leveling is fun and there is tones of content. whilst leveling you will mostly just doing quests and 5 man dungeons. however as you say there is big, but to be honest you wont be doing all of the content from vinilla and the old expansions (unless you really wanna do it) you will be just leveling to get to cap level, currently 100.  then you will be doing end game stuff like raids.  as for the community.  it can be pretty toxic at times but if you find a guild you will find a lot of nice players and that's the best way to play.

some other MMO i have enjoyed

GW2  i loved leveling, the story was alright and leveling was fun up to cap, however i quit after that because there was't enough end game content, but I've herd they have fixed a lot of that with there new expansion.

RIFT  this is now free to play. i didn't play for long but its pretty much a wow clone but with a bit of a difference as it has dynamic events everyone can do and i think the more you contribute you better the reward.

STAR WARS the old republic,  this is probably the best story and best solo experience ive ever had with an MMO.  however its free to play model is horrible.  i played it when i was sub and it was ok then, but now its free to play im not to sure.  as i say the story is amazing but i have no idear about the end game content.",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

"After reading through all the comments and your replies, these are my 2 cents:

- An immediate shutdown usually indicates a power failure somewhere. The ""minimal build"" (1 stick of ram in the leftmost socket, using intel HD for gfx, no unneeded peripherals) would be the way to go.

- One thing to note is that the intel HD will always be disabled if a gpu is plugged in, so hooking up a monitor there while the gpu is in the mobo won't work.

If that doesn't work, my guess would be either the mobo or the cpu is failing. This can be for several reasons.

- Try pressing the MemOK button on the top-right of the board, this will let the motherboard attempt a reconfiguration based on the current memory modules. Shouldn't help, but worth a shot.

- Second, bios. Your bios might be outdated. Ideally you could install an older cpu to see if that boots. But you could try the usb-flash method as described in the manual. Your motherboard may not immediately support the cpu you've installed. (edit: Just checked the available bios' for your mobo. Devil's canyon support is added in one of these versions, could be the issue)

And if both fail to work, I'm sorry to say your motherboard or cpu may be DOA (most likely the cpu, as the mobo does show some signs of life).",pcmasterrace,7,1200.0

"They chose to develop the game engine around a 30fps cap because they were squeezing the absolute most they could out of console hardware to build an open world environment. GTA wouldn't be what it is today if they had to aim for a 60fps average on a somewhat slow, single player third person action game. What sucks is the engine relies on the cap to be able to stream data live as you're traveling through the map. For some reason, it freaks the hell out if it's giving you more frames than it expects. 


Look at the difference between Halo 5 (60fps lock) and Destiny(30fps lock) on the Xbone. Halo 5, especially the multiplayer, looks absolutely terrible while I was actually impressed greatly by Destiny's visuals despite the framerate. Aiming for 60 spells out a shittier looking, shallower game all things considered on console hardware.

If I was still at 1080p I probably could have went a year or two mroe on my 970 because it has no problem at all playing games at that resolution.


If you're always playing the newest games at higher resolutions and you want max settings you will more than likely be upgrading at each new generation of cards. If you don't mind turning the settings down or you play older games then a GPU like this could last you years.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Done a few hiring of PIs for Organic Synthesis. All these are excellent. Also include a research summary, and please go over this with a fine tooth comb. Treat it as a fellowship application so no more than 3 pages for a total synthesis. Don't add superfluous reactions. We don't need a fluffer.

Apply everywhere and anywhere. Larger companies where I am at tend to take around a month or so until we start doing phone calls so don't be discouraged. We get ~300 applications, it's a lot to go through. BUT because we go through so much, we tend to lean on the familiar, so network. We tend to talk to professors we invite for lectures for any post-docs or new grads that may be qualified. They also drop us names that they met at so-and-so time as well.

For your research talk: practice, practice, practice. Don't go overboard with figures, it sometimes helps that you talk about it. Also talk about any problems you had, why something didn't work and how you fixed it, and know WHY it works. You can say you fixed something, not know why but only because your PI said so. REALLY bad. Doesn't matter if you were on one project or five, but you are fully 100% knowledgeable behind ALL the chemistry. We had one guy who did a post-doc at Scripps, and did a lot of med chem for graduate school. His work was impressive, but he failed to explain why certain reactions worked. For example why 5 eqvs of base was useful as opposed to just 2. He didn't get the position. 

Oh, and don't forget to acknowledge previous work that has been done whether in your lab or outside. We turned down an applicant that was adamant a certain Lewis Acid catalyzed transformation was hers and hers alone when one of our co-workers had done the same transformation five years ago. It is a very dick move, and tells us that you don't play well with others.  

Know the companies you were invited for an in-person interview for. You usually talk with four of us one-on-one throughout the day. We love you to ask questions. Some people just do all the talking but we stop to see if you have any questions. 

Just hired a new PI a couple months ago. We were slated to hire five more, but seeing as we are one the global companies that merged, that won't be happening anytime soon. I would suggest not to apply to either until the end of 2016. Sorry. It sucks for us too. ",chemistry,15,1200.0

"Unfortunately this image refers to one of the worst tests on Top Gear in recent years where Clarkson lost control of the BMW on an incredibly wet runway, then either he, or one of the writers decided to 100% blame the car for it. They then pushed it so far throughout the segment including the power lap that it just became stupid, more akin with reading something in a tabloid.

In this case the BMW is a far better example of value for money because it's far quicker and more exciting than the Golf but costs a small amount more. I'd also argue there's more badge involved with the Golf over the BMW, mainly because the BMW isn't a full M car. Therefore the Golf is the console, because it's a little cheaper but performs a lot worse and attracts people just because it's a GTI and the BMW is a PC that performs better without costing much more.

"""PC Master Race on Nintendo"" part was a little biased towards Nintendo hate, at first glance I only saw the bullet points.

The rest, while seemingly hostile to Nintendo, is more or less true.

&gt; there is no reason to throw money at an under-performing, over-priced and closed platform.

This is as far as most concerned, the standard policy for consoles in general. If we are going to hate xbox and ps4, we should at least objectively acknowledge  how nintendo's hardware is also locked down. The truth is, Nintendo could bring the market much more surplus had they chosen to just develop games instead of tying it to a console.

&gt;In contrary to popular belief, the Wii U has the least number of games running at 1080p/60FPS out of all 3 consoles

Not sure when it was released, not sure if it actually applies to xbox, but right about now there has been plenty of titles with 1080p 60fps(with a lot of dips, mind) on ps4. I agree now that the wording is fairly opinionated, but what it said holds true.

Even our beloved mods have spoken on this as well. I can see why this needs to be edited now after a closer inspection, but I think the underlying information it is providing should be retained

Everyone always says its such a great game, and after looking at it, it is! I love the 8-BIT style (I've always loved those type of games) and it seems really random and fun! I've been wanting to get it for quite a while but I just do NOT have enough money, sadly. A lot has been going on recently.

I also specifically like this giveaway because its 10$ on any game; and I have a Mac. What this means is that usually people giveaway games that are not compatible with Mac. And of course I don't think I'm getting a Windows Computer anytime soon (sadly), so its great when I can use that giveaway money on something else!

"Try this: 

1. Did you carefully read the motherboard owners manual?

2. Did you plug in the 4/8-pin CPU power connector located near the CPU socket? If the motherboard has 8 pins and your PSU only has 4 pins, you can use the 4-pin connector. The 4-pin connector USUALLY goes on the 4 pins located closest to the CPU. If the motherboard has an 8-pin connector with a cover over 4 pins, you can remove the cover and use an 8-pin plug if your power supply has one. This power connector provides power to the CPU. Your system has no chance of posting without this connector plugged in! Check your motherboard owners manual for more information about the CPU power connector. This is easily the most common new-builder mistake.

3. Did you install the standoffs under the motherboard? Did you place them so they all align with the screw holes in the motherboard, with no extra standoffs touching the board in the wrong place? A standoff installed in the wrong place can cause a short and prevent the system from booting.


4. Did you verify that the video card is fully seated? (may require more force than a new builder expects.)

5. Did you attach all the required power connector(s) to the video card? (some need two, some need none, many need one.)

6. Have you tried booting with just one stick of RAM installed? (Try each stick of RAM individually in each RAM slot.) If you can get the system to boot with a single stick of RAM, you should manually set the RAM speed, timings, and voltage to the manufacturers specs in the BIOS before attempting to boot with all sticks of RAM installed.


7. Did you verify that all memory modules are fully inserted? (may require more force than a new builder expects.) It's a good idea to install the RAM on the motherboard before it's in the case.

8. Did you verify in the owners manual that you're using the correct RAM slots? Many i7 motherboards require RAM to be installed in the slots starting with the one further away from the CPU which is the opposite of many dual channel motherboards.

9. Did you remove the plastic guard over the CPU socket? (this actually comes up occasionally.)

10. Did you install the CPU correctly? There will be an arrow on the CPU that needs to line up with an arrow on the motherboard CPU socket. Be sure to pay special attention to that part of the manual!

11. If using an after market CPU cooler, did you get any thermal paste on the motherboard, CPU socket, or CPU pins? Did you use the smallest amount you could? 

12. Is the CPU fan plugged in?

13. If using a stock cooler, was the thermal material on the base of the cooler free of foreign material, and did you remove any protective covering? If the stock cooler has push-pins, did you ensure that all four pins snapped securely into place? (The easiest way to install the push-pins is outside the case sitting on a non-conductive surface like the motherboard box. Read the instructions! The push-pins should be turned the OPPOSITE direction as the arrows.)


14. Are any loose screws laying on the motherboard, or jammed against it? Are there any wires run directly under the motherboard? You should not run wires under the motherboard since the soldered wires on the underside of the motherboard can cut into the insulation on the wires and cause a short. Some cases have space to run wires on the back side of the motherboard tray.

15. Did you ensure you discharged all static electricity before touching any of your components?

16. Did you install the system speaker (if provided) so you can check beep-codes in the manual? A system speaker is NOT the same as normal speakers that plug into the back of the motherboard. A system speaker plugs into a header on the motherboard that's usually located near the front panel connectors. If you case or motherboard didn't come with a system speaker you can buy one here: http://www.cwc-group.com/casp.html

17. Did you read the instructions in the manual on how to properly connect the front panel plugs? (Power switch, power led, reset switch, HD activity led) Polarity does not matter with the power and reset switches. If power or drive activity LED's do not come on, reverse the connections. For troubleshooting purposes, disconnect the reset switch. If it is shorted, the machine either will not POST at all, or it will endlessly reboot. 

18. Did you turn on the power supply switch located on the back of the PSU? Is the power plug on a switch? If it is, is the switch turned on? Is there a GFI circuit on the plug-in? If there is, make sure it isn't tripped.

19. Is your CPU supported by the BIOS revision installed on your motherboard? Most motherboards will post a CPU compatibility list on their website.

20. Have you tried resetting the CMOS? The motherboard manual will have instructions for your particular board.

21. If you have integrated video and a video card, try the integrated video port. Resetting the bios, can make it default back to the onboard video.

"I'm Australian so I'm not really sure about how it is in America, but in Australia being a console gamer is absolutely cheaper than being a PC gamer before calculating for games.  The initial cost of the console is significantly lower than that of a PC, especially when you consider that most households already have a television, while most do not have a spare monitor, headset and mouse. (I'm not going to bother with the math for games because on one hand, buying Fallout 4 through Steam for us would've cost over $100 AUD, but through other avenues the game could've been bought for $50 AUD, so there's no real point in talking about game prices when sales are all over the place.)

Don't get me wrong, I literally have not owned a non-Nintendo console since the PS2, so I'm not anti-PC or anything. But saying that PC gaming is cheaper is incorrect, whether you refer to the long or short term.

"I'm not sure if I agree with your conclusion here.  I've worked under / alongside numerous PIs and all of them have been outstanding chemists.  They've all been trained, to a very high degree.  The problem as I saw it (as part of the faculty at a top 10 US school for chemistry) was the administration.

The administrative burden on academic PIs is ridiculous.  Teaching classes, designing courses, overseeing research of sometimes 20+ group members, being on committees, traveling to conferences, departmental activities, writing grants, writing papers, reviewing papers for journals when asked, etc.  

Most academic PIs simply don't have the time to train a new grad student in lab methodology.  It's not that they couldn't; it's that they can't fit it into their schedule.  Part of the shock you get going to grad school is that you think you're going to work under some great professor, only to find that your training comes from postdocs and older graduate students.  Ultimately, you end up teaching yourself.

When I was a PI in industry (R+D lab for scaleup), it was a completely different story.  A few meetings here and there, but for the most part I was in the lab, the majority of the time actually.  So I don't know if it's necessarily a malicious act on the part of academic PIs, but I do agree that their students would benefit enormously from their presence in the lab, teaching them technique.  Of course their students also benefit from being funded, so there's that

Be careful as well because some of the HDMI 2.0 spec can ""fit"" under the 10.2Gbps.  For example 4k60 at 4:2:0 subsampling can.  So some manufacturers will list those as ""HDMI 2.0 Compatible"" even if it is only the most basic support for part of HDMI 2.0.  They don't actually support the rest of the HDMI 2.0 spec.

"If you really wanted to upgrade your CPU on your FM2+ socket, youd go with an Athlon X4 860K (not sure why no one is telling you this)

It has no onboard graphics, so it is about half the price of an A10 APU (as APUs strive for better integrated graphics)

It is also more powerful than the A10-7870K, the newest/best APU.

The 960 will not be bottlenecked *as much* by the Athlon X4 860K, but it will still be slightly bottlenecked. Your cheapest solution is this, though, obviously, as it is an $80 CAN (on a nice sale) solution as opposed to a $300 CAN solution (mobo + i5, no reason to go i3 as that is a huge waste of money for minimal performance gain)

See benchmarks here:

[A10-6700](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+A10-6700+APU) (see big red number)

"&gt;Anyone can change up their benchmarks if they want to lol. 

Prove they are somehow lying in favor or nvidia because they were paid. If you cannot prove this then stop acting like they is some conspiracy against the 390. The benchmarks give specific results, we then judge which card is CURRENTLY the better performer off of these.

&gt;Most benchmarks and most people on the internet will tell you that the R9 390 is much more powerful.

The benchmarks I provided are significantly more recent with more recent drivers compared to JayZ video, not to mention goes through a larger number of games.

All of those links do literally nothing, they are either forum posts which I just said I couldn't care less about since they aren't reviewers who benchmark titles in a professional way, nor should they have to be. We already have those and I used them in my very first link. The rest are reviews of the 390 on release which again, means nothing since all of the benchmarks I linked were much more recent and thus give a better representation of both cards performance.",pcmasterrace,-15,1200.0

"I'd like screencheat. I have a long joke for you (worth the read):

Three friends, seeking great fortune, visit a newly discovered pyramid. Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

All the installed drivers for the hardware in the first PC will be wrong for the new PC, so you will need to install new drivers. if you don't uninstall all the old drivers then there's a risk they could cause you some issues as well.

"&gt;Hmm I guess you can never change a Nvidia user even if his precious gimped 3.5 GB 970 is a little weaker than the 390

Where are the benchmarks more recent than what I provided that somehow prove this? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying prove you're right. I gave you benchmarks to support my claim, you have yet to give any that can support yours. As I said, the reviews you linked are from release, you need results closer to now to be making your argument.

&gt; Just because you own it doesn't mean its better than the competition.

It did better in the benchmarks I provided. That's what makes it better. I don't own a 970, I own a 980ti. 

&gt;Looking through your reddit account and it seems that every post you make supports Nvidia even if its worse than the competition

I'm not a fan of people being blatantly ignorant. When I see someone perpetuating something that is wrong, I generally call them out on it. Unfortunately with the current state of the sub, I have to argue about information regarding nvidia more than I'd like to.

You also didn't prove it's worse than the competition, all you said is a ton of people apparently think it's better which is great and all, but there are alot of people who think Xenu dropped human souls into a volcano and we flew into the inhabitants of this world. So sorry if I don't put too much faith in what just a bunch of people believe without evidence.

&gt;which in turns gets your comments EXTREMELY downvoted because your posts are biased and are not the actual true fact.

Downvotes=/=Non-factual.

Actually for me it's quite the opposite. I always link my sources and back up my claims. People generally downvote some of my comments because they simply don't agree with what I say on a personal level, which is fine I don't care.

&gt;Just face it, the R9 390 is better.

Prove it.

&gt;Make a post in this subreddit and ask which card is better, you will be surprised at the results!

You're asking me to get an answer ad populum which is fallacious. I want evidence and sources that my sources are somehow invalid.

"That's not true. There were several reasons why Intel switched to a conventional TIM, and the insane heat issues most people had were because of an over-zealous application of epoxy between the IHS and PCB that created a gap between the underside of the IHS and the die of the chip itself.  

Overclocker der8auer made an excellent post at overclocking.guide/the-truth-about-cpu-soldering/ on the subject that covers exactly this, and solders an i7 then overclocks it and runs it to prove exactly why they don't solder their mainstream chips anymore.  

The TL;DR is that the die is so small and puts out so much heat that it causes microfractures in the solder that eventually damage the die of the CPU and decrease cooling performance. This can still happen on extreme edition chips and 2011-v3 socket chips (which are all soldered) but is much harder to induce because of the larger die size and more surface area to transfer less heat per given unit of said area.  

You would do well to research a subject before slandering a company and starting a flamewar in the comments. Intel is a multi-billion dollar company with some of the greatest engineers on earth in their employ, they wouldn't have made the switch if there wasn't a good reason for it, and you look like a fool for claiming otherwise when proof to the contrary from an independent source that's universally well-acclaimed on the subject matter has existed for more than a full month.

"... my brain legitimately hurts reading your response.

When you build a computer, you do not build it SPECIFICALLY for gaming. You build it so that you can use it to do a whole load of things, but with an emphasis on gaming.

Also, have you actually tried playing PC in your living room? When my computer died a few years ago, and all I had was a laptop with a broken screen, I did. I hooked up my laptop to my TV and that was my form of entertainment for a good five months. Except that meant I was always having family conflicts due to them wanting to use the TV (and me wanting to game), it also meant that my posture was fucking terrible because I had the keyboard in my lap and the mouse on the arm of a chair, or I was sitting on the floor hunched over with my hands on the mouse and keyboard in front of me, or I had the mouse and keyboard on the coffee table while I sat on the floor, arms raised to reach it.

Face it, it is not always economically possible for someone to be a PC gamer. While there are excess expenditures for console players (PSN/XBL, for example), they can often be less of a burden then the cost of PC gaming.

I wish you, or for that matter, this entire subreddit would look at this from an objective point of view. But I may as well talk to a brick wall, you are set in your ways and nothing I say can change that.

And since you seem to think that there are PCs that can game well at the same price point as a console in Australia, let me show you why you're wrong:

A [500GB PlayStation 4 costs $399](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/games-consoles/games/Gaming-Consoles/ps4-console/ps4-playstation-4-500gb-console/760368/) in Australia. A [500GB XBox One costs $399](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/games-consoles/games/Gaming-Consoles/xbox-one-console/xbox-one-500gb-console/761463/) in Australia.  
[This](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/XpHJhM) is the ""Media Elite"" build on the PCMR wiki. It is $340USD ($390USD before rebates). WITHOUT the processor, motherboard or case, which aren't even SOLD in Australia, it comes to [$314](http://puu.sh/mgnwI/691935a03f.png). You don't even have the heart or the body of the computer, and you're already almost at your budget.  
So I added the cheapest compatible CPU and motherboard (which are inferior to the one in the ""Media Elite"" build), and the cheapest case available, too, and look what we get: the [total cost is $525](http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/frGRD3), which is, in fact, MORE than that of a console. Now, again, this is without taking accessories into account, but if you buy either of the consoles I listed, the ONLY thing you need to start playing is a TV/monitor. That's not necessarily the case for the PC that you've just bought.

But, whatever, you'll likely just call me a peasant, downvote this and move on.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"Okay I spent ages typing out a solution, not realizing I had gone full retard and not read all of your comments. 
After reading them all, I can say with utter certainty it can only be 1 of two things. 

1. Your fans spin up for a second then they power down again, this can mean that you have one of the case connectors plugged into the wrong place, or one of the other connectors plugged into the wrong place as both components are able to draw power and for that split second the computer thinks it's all clear, but when performing the checks [these take fractions of a second] something is wrong and it powers down again. I would imagine if you did have a speaker it would be giving you a certain bleep at this point to convey what I just said. In this case I suggest you double and triple check every single connection, removing the graphics card just because its one less thing and using the onboard graphics. 

2. Something is dead, or dying. You have established [by checking both RAM DIMM's] that it isn't your RAM, nor is it the graphics card which wouldn't cause this issue in the first place, if it was an issue with the quality control on the PSU it just wouldn't work in the first place, so it can only be the motherboard or the CPU. I assure you, if option 1 doesn't work [if all components are new then option 1 is almost certainly the solution as DOA is considerably rarer than people on this sub make out, especially with the components you listed] then the issue lies with either your CPU or your motherboard. If it was the motherboard that is doa/damaged it's incredibly unlikely it would flash any light, let alone change to a green LED after changing the power connectors meaning it's going to be the CPU. You might have some bent pins in the socket, it isn't the thermal connection as if it was your PC would turn on and just get very very hot very very quickly and the heatsink has 0 bearing on anything so yeah, rip CPU in this instance. 

After reading your comments, it realistically CANNOT be anything else. with problems like this it's all about how many things can you rule out, and you have ruled out almost everything except the above two. My personal opinion is option 1, not that I mean to question your build skills but it's what the optimist inside me wants to believe as with issues like you have described, option 1 is almost always the case. 
I know how painful issues like this are, there really is nothing worse than building a new PC and having something as shitty as this happen but take comfort in the fact that you WILL get this problem sorted eventually, and be ascended my child. ",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

&gt;Please take note the 390 has better future-proofing capability than the 970

No it doesn't.

Not according to the benchmarks.

That is a synthetic benchmark, I asked for real life scenarios, in-game benchmarks like what I provided. This is also not very representative of real life since going by this the 980 beats the fury when in actual benchmarks it easily beats the 980.

I know about the vram issue, it's 4gb but segmented into 3.5gb/.5gb sections. I'd rather not get into a long discussion about this as well.

"Thank you for Dawn of War. I will edit my post in some time, showing and explaining my solution in python, since I was too lazy to write in C.

EDIT: The '\^' in OP's program is the [XOR function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). We take every two adjacent characters of the code and do an XOR of them. Since we know that the last character of the code is 3, we can do 98 ^ the ASCII code of 3 to find the other character and work our way back that way. Here is a quick solution in Python.

    arr = [29, 97, 96, 110, 27, 100, 10, 123, 113, 122, 30, 110, 8, 25, 3, 98]
    prev = ord('3')
    code = ""3""
    for element in reversed(arr):
        prev = prev ^ element
        code += chr(prev)
    print(code[::-1])

Arr is the result of OP's program put into a list. Prev stores the ASCII code of the last character we have found. Code will contain the complete code for the game by the time the loop is finished (albeit the code will be in reverse). The code itself was DY8X6-IC8I3-CKRQ3.",pcmasterrace,5,1200.0

"&gt;even in THAT case its better to buy a cheap PC

Wrong, as shown.

&gt;If you build a PC for more than that a console is out of question anyway

literally what is this train of thought. ""if you want to browse facebook and download music then you shouldn't buy a console anyway! LOL!!!""

&gt;the same with a console

Yeah, except a family is much more accepting of you playing videogames in the lounge room and taking up the TV than they are of you taking up the TV for hours at a time backing up data or installing new programs or downloading music or games or doing anything else that you would otherwise do on a computer. Why the hell can't you understand that nobody builds a computer JUST to game. NOBODY DOES THAT. Even if gaming is its primary function, you will still use it for a myriad of other things.

&gt;well Australia is an expensive country

Fixed that for you. Australia is expensive as fuck which is why PC gaming is shit here.

"Sigh, I really hate seeing people go through this type of shit but the reality is that shitty parenting is more common than you would expect.

When I was (probably) your friends age, my dad was mad about something that had to do with me, I don't exactly remember but I know it didn't justify what he did. Anyway, while I wasn't home, he came into my room, took my hella fancy mechanical keyboard, and proceeded to bash it off my monitors until they broke. I got home and the carnage was noticeable from outside of my room, I saw a few number keys sitting by the door and I was worried. I came in to find my room DESTROYED and my 2 monitors totally shattered and broken to pieces. As a 15 year old this was devastating because money was not something that could just so easily ""be made"", we were a poor family, and he essentially ruined more than half of my investments.

So here comes my reaction that I TOTALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND, but for the sake of telling the story and that I felt good about what I did after years and years of abuse. I went upstairs with a hammer while he was on his computer, and I said ""You better fucking replace everything thing you broke or I'm going to break what I deem equal worth"" and he immediately jumped up and started throwing punches at me, I managed to really fuck up his arm with the hammer and I proceeded to smash his fancy monitor and computer.

But in the end, he called the police and they believed him over me, I got arrested for simple assault, and nobody my dad nor me won because everything was broken, and in the end, all it did was make my family hate each other even more than they already did.

This would flush out the standing water which could be picking up the contaminant (say from the pipes) over time. If you don't get any symptoms this way, then it could be that something is gradually leaching into the water from the pipework.

Then again, if your water is giving you those kinds of symptoms that quickly, maybe you shouldn't be sampling it directly anymore. If you do, take in only a small amount and only take more if you feel fine.

You already said the water next door was fine. How many of your neighbors did you check with? I would try to ask a few more of your neighbors in all directions from your house if they have any issues with drinking their tap water. This would at least make it certain that the issue is coming from your house alone.

"... you dont understand me probably just as much as I dont understand you. 

You have 400$ and you live in the USA. ""if you want to browse facebook and download music then"" you need a PC (or a tablet, laptop or anything like that) anyway. The console is NOT a option with ONLY that money. 

Now lets assume you only want to do stuff that a console can, nothing more. A PC for the same price can do the same stuff just better. You can use it in your living room with the same controller and play mostly the same games.

In this case you should always go for the PC. You argue that nobody likes that you ""you taking up the TV for hours at a time backing up data or installing new programs or downloading music or games or doing anything else that"" while downloadings games is the same on consoles just slower (hello 5200rpm laptop HDD). Well you dont have to spent a single second more on the TV to do the same stuff that you would do on a console. If you do MORE than a console does and you need a monitor because of that (or more time at the TV) than thats a bonus, something that a PC can do MORE than a console and something that you dont HAVE TO DO. Its not a negative point of a PC since you can just not do it (and with a console you CANT do it).

Please stop using optional stuff that you can do but dont have to as a negative point for PC users. Ofcourse everyone uses a PC for stuff like these and has a keyboard and mouse but that is a great additional thing. With a console you wouldnt do that. So... if you have to use the TV then just dont do these additional things...

"&gt; hen I was running my 970 it struggled with the VRAM on demanding games like GTA V - 4GB turned out to be not enough for Ultra Settings with most games today.

Except this isn't true at all?

Vram is used to mainly to BUFFER FRAMES (which is why Vram can cause a **HARD CAP** on FPS), your vram affects how complex each frame that is stored can be on average, Ultra HD textures and some settings can make this shoot up because of them being greedy for v-ram. On top of that, 
**different games use vram differently**. 4 Gb is the industry standard for a reason, It's already more than you need. Even games notoriously bad for vram hogging like wolfenstein or shadow of mordor run perfectly, even with ultra HD textures, on my 4 Gb 980. If i had to say what was wrong on your end, i would guess that you had some of those ""super advanced"" settings that kill FPS on any card on without realizing it.

The R9 390 isn't a bad card, and neither is the 970. If you are on a budget, look at what is right for you. Nvidia is more USER friendly, AMD is more MARKET friendly.

It creates enough pressure to lift the lid off a little, but the majority of heat is dissipated by conviction through the metal and out to the air. It takes longer to cool it down because the lid is keeping the heat in place.

The amount of Vram would be a great upgrade, but the difference will not be night and day unless you can take advantage of it with a decent refresh rate monitor. You will go from having to tweak settings to being able to get a stable framerate to often just hitting the ultra preset. Sure it sounds cool, and it is, but i would say to wait.

You can either save money to get a higher-tier card (which i definitely recommend if the card in your system is decent) or wait for pascal.

"This is exactly what I just taught myself (surprisingly on accident) to do recently. 

One day, our WiFi stopped working, and instead of going to the router and manually pressing the reset switch, I went to the router's settings and clicked ""reboot."" It started working again after a simple reset.

-- Our Internet speeds are actually quite good, ironically. ~100 down, 10 up, 20 ping. It just happened to stop working randomly this day. --

Then, I started just messing around in router settings, and was looking at all of the settings. I started to wonder if I could prevent certain people access to the WiFi, and began my investigation.

After a while, I found something labeled ""DHCP Clients"" that showed all of my family member's devices that were connected, along with their IP and MAC adresses.

After like, another hour of messing around, I found ""MAC Filtering."" I originally thought I would enter their device's unique IP to block it, but then realized I had to enter their MAC address.

-- Mind you, I'm not that knowledgeable about router hardware, and don't know too much about other Internet stuff. 
Although, I do know a little bit about IP adresses and other stuff involving that (I learned how to DDoS a few years ago). But I was basically just messing around at this point. --

So, I found the downstair's TV's MAC address, entered it into the filter, and checked the ""Deny"" box.

I watched the TV's WiFi go off, and was amazed. Quickly turned it back on, though. I didn't want to actually do anything nefarious to the WiFi when there was literally no reason to, plus the fact that I'm not the one that pays for it.

But if I ever comes across a situation like this, I'm glad I taught myself to MAC filter.

Edit: **Just to be clear**, I have never, and will never actually DDoS anyone, that's a shitty thing to do. I simply learned how with a basic botnet out of curiosity. ",pcmasterrace,5,1200.0

"Overprovisioning is to extend life of your SSD. Each time cells get written, erased and written again, they degrade. SSDs internal firmware uses empty space to shuffle data around, so wear on cells gets evenly spread out. SSDs usually have some internal space that you are unable to see and use for this purpose (kinda like spare blocks in mechanical hard-drives), but you can help your SSD by leaving some unused space, too. Ideally one half.

That's theory. Now, in real life ... number of writes for those cells is couple thousands. With normal everyday use (operating systems, games, interwebs, creative software suits), based on information Magician shows about my older drive, it will take me 40 years to write enough data to get to the point when it starts to wear out.

"I posted this in a comment on the daily sale thread:


I picked it up during the summer sale. Honestly, probably one of the best games I bought. I love the minimalist art style, and the game puts a really nice focus on art style. I have not gotten to a point where I felt that I could just stay in one spot and survive, you constantly have to keep moving to find food, fuel for fires, shelter, etc. There's a lot to explore and the devs are pretty good about releasing updates and adding content.


Speaking of new content, the game only has sandbox mode right now, but story mode is supposed to begin being released in March '16. IIRC, they are releasing the story mode in an episodic style, and anyone who purchases the game in EA has full access to the episodes.


I should also include that I have noticed framerate drops in some of the larger, more open areas in the game. I haven't played since the last optimization update so that may be fixed, but even with that issue I never drop below 40FPS.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

&gt;With User-friendliness of NVIDIA.. well. The only pro that I see in NVIDIA cards is Shadowplay.

I haven't installed an AMD GPU in a few years so i don't know if the process has changed for installing drivers, but do they have anything like the Geforce experience? Do AMD cards run at the same temps as comparable nvidia cards as well? I would never recommend a GPU that runs as hot as some AMD cards simply because they require special care sometimes, something that is not very user friendly.

Don't get me wrong, i do not hate AMD or people who use their cards, i'm just saying that if i am building a system for someone else, or even suggesting a part, if i do not know the person i will almost always suggest nvidia unless told otherwise simply because my personal experience has led me to nvidia being the easier to maintain of the two.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"As I mentioned in another post, there's a backhaul duopoly for access to the phone exchanges.  Although some UK ISPs don't have data caps, they achieve this by buying only as much backhaul capacity as their revenue model will support, and basically accepting the congestion that results.  They are slowly improving the management of said congestion, rather than just slapping charges all over the heavy users in a vain attempt to control demand.

This particular ISP doesn't do that.  It buys enough backhaul capacity to satisfy demand at almost all times, and reacts as quickly as possible to exceptional surges (usually due to sporting events or major news).  IPv6 is fully and properly supported (they've insisted on certain bugfixes in the supplied router's firmware), you also get a static, fully public IPv4 address (a real luxury these days), and if there's a line fault, they'll go above and beyond the call of duty to get it fixed (they're literally the best in the country at leaning on the monopoly last-mile provider).  Often, they'll identify a fault before *you* do, especially if it affects a whole exchange or backhaul link.

This terabyte-per-month scheme is actually an *improvement* over the status quo in the UK.  A large one.  It's potentially valuable even to people who can't get anywhere near the full 80Mbps down.

"While I don't agree with ...PonkyBreaksYourPC... I'll admit the upgrade may not be worth it, after some research, it looks like you'll be recieving a mild performance boost going to the 860K (it may be most noticeable on the CPUbenchmark.net website, other benchmarking websites indeed don't show such a large increase). 

I upgraded from an A8-5500, so I experienced a very noticeable leap in performance.

My thinking is specifically geared to Fallout 4 and the ""draw-calls"" I mentioned earlier. Fallout 4 is possibly one of the most CPU dependant titles out there, and its important for immersion to not get frame dips. If you won't be playing Fo4, then you don't need to care about what I say at all!

As I said elsewhere, you might be better off doing what I did, and playing with your APU + GPU for now, and then building a dedicated gaming rig later (when you can't bear to run games on your ""slow"" CPU anymore) and return your prebuilt PC to normal.

"Catalyst Control Center (CCC) especially their new Crimson version is basically AMD's counterpart of GFE. AMDs temps have also gotten better. It was a big problem of the Stock/Reference 290-Models but on the other hand, NVIDIA's Titan X is not one of the coolest cards either. TDP has gotten better with newer models and less TDP is expected for the new cards (because of FINFET, same goes for NV's cards). 

Basically saying, the Radeon R9 Nano which is probably the smallest, most powerful air-cooled card you can get is kept cool by just a single fan. The Fury X as AMDs flagship model is being watercooled, whilst the 'regular' Fury models are air cooled. I am not quite sure about the following, but I believe the Fury's of some vendors are Fury X's that have been clocked down to minimize TDP.

Getting back to the VRAM-thingy:
even if it would not use the whole 8 GB of VRAM I think we can agree that more than 4GB would suit it very well. The VRAM consumption starts skyrocketing if you use Anti Aliasing at high resolutions with not-that-good optimized titles.

as an example:
Far Cry 4 at TXAA4 @ Ultra presets:

1080p: 2596MB without AA, 3068MB with.

1440p: 2820MB w/o AA, 3771MB with.

2160p/4K: 3699 w/o, 5773MB with. 


and the 1440p with AA is already that sweet spot where you could get problems (with that whole 970 3,5GB-thing). 

To get back to the basics...
You may be right that 4GB are the industry standard for video games and it is probably enough for the most games. 

Going ahead and looking at titles that are badly optimized, even tho called ""Triple-A"" (FC4, Shadow of Mordor, GTA V) you want to have more.

killawatt 

that only tells you your power draw at the wall, not the overall system power consumption however.

To figure that out you need to get the Killawatt figure, find out what the efficiency of your PSU is at that load on the 12V rail and then times it by whatever that number is (also you need to make sure you're getting it's efficiency for the right socket, if running on 110V it will have worse efficiency than 23VA).

E.G

600w on the 12v rail

kill a watt says 300w

so find a review and see what efficiency your psu is at that load

say it's 85% on 110V

 you could to take into account that the killawatt reading is higher due to the psu not 100% efficient if you want to be totally accurate but that doesn't really matter

so anyway, times your Killawatt reading by that number, so 300 x 0.85 = system power draw

As I said, this isn't 100% accurate as the killawatt figures are gonna be higher due to the psu's efficiency, the actual efficiency of that psu would be like 84.5% at that load so the real figure would be 300 x 0.845 = system power draw

"Plenty of people have gained from gaming.. I never used to be able to talk new people and strangers in public now being in my consoles and ICe I learned that I'm comfortable with my personality and now I'm usually the life of the party. 

Gaming also kept my friend off the streets and I even got him to drop out of a gang so he can spend more time in a comfortable setting instead of out on the streets where people bullied him because they were intimidated because of him. 

It's also a huge stress relief being a form of entertainment. That's what I use it for because living paycheck to paycheck with limited options because of certain situations is tough. 

It also helps me stay in touch with family just having a good time. My brothers don't get much but the weekends and I work every other weekend and 12 hour shifts (3p-3a) so I never get to see them but being able to play games together has kept us close and in the know with each other. 

And about the whole Dad situation.. He's an ass hat.. He should be teach his kid with work / reward system.. If your just working your entire life to get by then your not living your staying alive.. If you work hard you deserve to tie that to a value that you can enjoy so you can learn that hard work pays off with a real sense of physical value you can touch albeit a book, trip to see family you lost contact with, a pet or even a PC.

"Not a matter of them getting more traffic, but the fact that they are simply well known due to their invasive watermarked ""original"" content that is then reposted back into Reddit, Imgur, Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr.

Not 100% accurate stats, but closest you'll find coming out of one source:

[9gag](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/9gag.com)
 Global Rank: 206

[Reddit](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com)
 Global Rank: 33

[Imgur](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/imgur.com)
 Global Rank: 46

Stats themselves don't suggest that they should be well known, but based on sites people are hitting before hitting 9gag it's Facebook and Reddit most noticeably. And with Reddit and Facebook's rank, there is no surprise that 9gag is well known as these are large communities. 9gag has a higher bounce rate than Reddit or Imgur (bounce being a one time hit, then leaving). So 9gag has no rank because people aren't spending time browsing (only 5.23 pageviews per user), but they are getting a lot of individual hits.

TL;DR

Not more traffic, just more widely seen. Their content is reposted and that's how it's known. Reposted content doesn't give 9gag the hits, so they don't have the numbers to show.

The board he has is really super unsuited to an AMD 125W CPU, will be roasting the VRMs and probably throttling without him noticing. 

I'd use something like a Noctua NH-C12P for it.

Noctua NH-C14S would probably be the best bet. It would give his VRMs some cooling to prevent throttling, else his upgrade might actually damage performance. Honestly I'd just change the board.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

literally doesn't matter.

&gt;links and videos that prove that the R9 390 is better than the 970.

Again, from the beginning of the year. As drivers and hardware matures results will change. We have to keep this in mind when recommending cards.

&gt;Ask this subreddit, ask any forum on the internet and they will say the R9 390 is better from experience

Their experience does not give an objective look at both cards in comparison. This is why professional benchmarks are required for these things.

I was unaware wanting evidence and sources made me ignorant. I don't go against AMD products, I go against ignorant information.

I've spent so much time spent on that game. If you add a few mods and assets, it can improve your experience. Be aware that some assets and mods may require another mod or asset to work. You can easily find what it needs on its own page. I also highly recommend the After Dark DLC.

[Here's a city I'm working on.](http://imgur.com/a/WByHC)

Some mods I strongly recommend are:

* District themes
* Better traffic AI (forgot the exact name)
* Airport roads (for more realistic airports)
* Network Extensions
* Random tree rotation
* One way street arrows
* Terraform tool
* First person camera
* Automatic bulldozer

I ended up taking out the gpu from the mobo and reseating it a tad higher. It turned out gpu sag and the gpu not being 100% seated caused the mobo to shutdown the computer immediately.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835220055

The product picture really, really does not do justice to how absolutely fucking gigantic this cooler is, and I actually had a moment of panic when I opened it and saw how colossal it was.  I knew getting it in my computer was going to be an issue, and it had nothing to do with my case.  The motherboard layout just wasn't designed with something that stupidly large in mind.

However, I'm not the type to RMA something if putting a little work into it will make it better than anything else available that officially does ""fit"" my motherboard, so my dad loaned me his dremel tool and away I went.  It looks rough, but the cooler hardly flinched at all the abuse I gave it and still works great.

The hardness isn't really a problem the way I see it.  I don't know if the 100 mg/L listed for the standard there is just a median for the standard range, because it's lower than the maximum of the ""good quality"" range I'm used to working with in the Australian Drinking Water guidelines and I can't think why it'd be different.   It definitely shouldn't have health affects like this.  The lack of extreme softness and the high pH means the water shouldn't be corroding the pipes at all either.

This is going to be a diagnosis by elimination I think.

"That's an intriguing idea, but [this WHO document](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/0304_74/en/index8.html) refers to a no-observed-adverse-effects level of 6.0 mg/kg of body weight per day. I have trouble imagining OP ingesting that dose, especially given the following excerpt from the WHO report:

&gt;Antimony at one time was considered as a possible replacement for lead in solders, but there is no evidence of any significant contribution to drinking-water concentrations from this source. The concentrations in drinking-water appear to be less than 5 µg/litre (US EPA, 1984; Longtin, 1985).
 
So even if OP were only 50 kg and were drinking a liter at a time, the water would still have to have antimony levels 60,000 times as high as the EPA found to have an effect. I just don't see 300 mg of antimony dissolving from solder into one drink of water. 

Also, the WHO says that

&gt;At one time, antimony was suggested as a possible replacement for lead in solders, but there is no evidence that this has occurred. 

It's definitely worth ruling out, especially since antimony isn't in the standard water tests, but it doesn't seem super likely to me. I'm not an expert, though! And thank you for sharing all the historical information about antimony, that was really interesting to read. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"do you know what an implosion nuke is?

&gt;Instead, the plutonium is present as a subcritical sphere (or other shape), which may or may not be hollow. Detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere, increasing the density (and collapsing the cavity, if present) to produce a prompt critical configuration. This is known as an implosion type weapon.

do you know what a critical mass is?

&gt;A critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.

yes?

&gt;The critical mass for lower-grade uranium depends strongly on the grade: with 20% U-235 it is over 400 kg; with 15% U-235, it is well over 600 kg.

Plutonium is extremely difficult to make bombs out of. You cannot simply shove two masses of plutonium together and expect it to blow. It will fizzle out unless you shove all of it together into one point where the entire thing can fission before any of the material escapes.

Presumably a crude nuke would simply be two halves of a critical mass of U-235, much like, but not exactly like, the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs, the warhead of which would weigh at least half a ton or more.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

I'm not familiar with Unigine Valley so I cant say whether or not that is a substantial enough test for the issue I believe you are having... When you thermal throttle your cpu frequency is lowered to keep it from over heating. When this happens the workload going to your GPU decreases because the CPU cant keep up with the demand of the game anymore.

"To be fair, Boogie seems to have gone a long time *talking* about losing weight and not making much progress.

I'm an avid listener of PKA, a podcast that he's appeared on several times and when he's on he talks alot about his health. He knows a ton about the subject and I've spent alot of time listening to him talk about different diets, exercise programs, and medicine. What's sad is that he knows a ton about health and losing weight, yet every time I check out his channel he seems to have made zero progress.

While I only watch his channel every once and a while, I'm a big fan of the *man* himself. I think he's an outstanding guy, and I would very much like to see him succeed, yet even though he has a wealth of knowledge, a huge fan base supporting him, and plenty of money and resources others don't, he still hasn't lost weight.

The only game I payed for was JC3 and I got it on sale for $30 it runs great for me about 80-90FPS at highest settings 1440p specs in flair its a lot of fun just to play around I will sometimes boot it up just to fly around with the wing suit I recommend one mod for it to skip the horrible long intro thing.  
  
I received MGS with my GPU it is fun but I just couldn't really get into it but it is pretty and one of the best running games as of recent.  
  
I got ACS with my SSD I don't know why people are saying that it sucks my only complaint with it was the cape physics was locked to 30FPS but that has since been fixed I would say it is as good as AC4 (Black Flag) probably the only game I will finish completely it has amazing characters, a huge map, and a pretty good story.  
  
JC3 has the best raw game play, and MGS has a good balance between excellent game play and story. (Although the story was weird to me and really dropped off on the second half.) Also I have never tried the multiplayer for MGS.",pcmasterrace,2,1200.0

A Jewish businessman in Brooklyn decided to send his son to Israel to absorb some of the culture of the homeland. When the son returned, the father asked him to tell him about his trip. The son said, ""Pop, I had a great time in Israel. Oh, and by the way, I converted to Christianity."" ""Oh, my,"" said the father. What have I done?"" He decided to go ask his old friend Jacob what to do. Jake said, ""Funny you should ask. I too sent my son to Israel, and he also came back a Christian. Perhaps we should go see the rabbi and ask him what we should do."" So they went to see the rabbi. The rabbi said, ""Funny you should ask. I too sent my son to Israel. He also came back a Christian. What is happening to our young people? The three of them prayed and explained what had happened to their sons and asked God what to do. Suddenly a voice came loud and clear from Heaven.

"That's a complicated question.  Some people will claim it is no matter what argument you or anyone may bring to the table to showcase the XIM is not a cheat device.

----------------------------

On the one hand you have people that use the device due to disabilities that make using a controller hard for FPS gameplay (I fall into this category) and on the other you have people that claim it is a comfort thing or that they had used M/K their whole life and have no desire to switch between the two control methods yet still want to enjoy FPS games on both PC and consoles.

-----------------------

I won't lie, there are those who get the XIM to ""dominate"" casual players and it makes them feel tough.  The XIM does give you better precision unless you are some controller god that can use max sensitivity in every FPS game while still going for them head shots.

---------------------------

At the end of the day the XIM is limited by what is possible on a controller.  I cannot turn faster than a controller user and the device makers have left out macro support so that no one can use something like rapid-fire by only using the XIM.  The device only translates the controls to the M/K combo and the rest is up to player skill.  While a XIM will make an average player like myself better it won't make us MLG pros.

-------------------

So is it cheating? It depends on who you are talking to and why they made the purchase.  For me it was a combination of disability and comfort.  The rest is up to you to decide.",pcmasterrace,3,1200.0

"Definitely Just Cause 3 imo. Metal Gear is good fun and has a decent story, but I personally didn't think it was that amazing. 

Just Cause 3 has such fun potential, it's really great to be able to run around and do what you want. There are so many possibilities in it and it is really fun.

Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a bit of a let down, it's ok, it's not great. It's very similar to the other AC games as you might expect and the story is pretty average.

It all comes down to the playstyle you enjoy the most; 

If you enjoy a good story driven game with fairly easy combat because the story is what is important, go with MGS V. 

If you enjoy running around and blowing shit up in the coolest possible ways and you really enjoy fucking with random civilians and pulling down helicopters with cars (it's really fun to do), then definitely go with JC3.

If you really like the somewhat stealthy mechanics of an AC game and you like a game with a decent mix of combat and story, go with ACS. ",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0
