These effects lead to substantial differences in reactivity of the lantanides and actinides. Due to f orbital expansion, actinides can actually use their f orbitals for bonding, and they can access a wide range of oxidation states. In contrast, the relativistic effects for lanthanides are less, and thus the 4f orbitals are more contracted, are not involved in bonding, and we only see a single oxidation state for most of the lanthanides (+3).",chemistry,6,1200.0

"*These aren't answers, but the steps to find the solution. Homework points are trivial, so* ***make sure you can do this on a test by yourself.***

**Problem #1:** ethanol mass

* 1 L = 1000 mL

* 1 mL = 1 cm^3

* Convert your volume to cm^3 

* Density = Mass / Volume --&gt; Mass = Density * Volume

* You have volume (now in terms of cm^3 ) and density ( g / cm^3 )

**Problem #2:** Lithium / Nitrogen

* Mass = # protons + # neutrons

* \# protons = # electrons

* Atomic number (on periodic table) = # protons = # electrons

* Isotope = same number of protons, electrons (same atomic #)--different number of neutrons (different mass)
 
**Problem #3:** The sun

* They give you distance (m) and velocity (m/s)

* Time (s) = distance (m) / velocity (m/s) --&gt; units of seconds

* \# seconds / 60 = # minutes

**""Problem"" #4:** kilogram definition

* The definition of a kilogram is 1000 g so there are 3,290,000 g in 3290 kg. 

* The math is: 3290 kg * ( 1000 g / 1 kg )

"If you had a mixture of gold plus particles of rock (typical gold-bearing ore), then mercury extraction works nicely, since the mercury only dissolves the gold and not the rock. But if you are starting with an alloy of gold plus other metals, mercury is not of much use, since it will dissolve most metals in addition to the gold.

However, you could try the borax method. Break up the lump of alloy into small pieces and mix with borax - either granules or powder. Then put the mixture in a crucible and heat it. You need to get it hot enough to melt the gold (1065 ^o C), which is considerably more than the melting point of borax (750 ^o C). A bunsen burner or propane-butane blowtorch isn't quite enough for this. A kerosene blowtorch will do it, as would an acetylene torch. But a charcoal fire with air blown through it (like a blacksmith forge) is probably the easiest - just use a barbecue and a set of bellows.

Gold has a lower melting point than copper or platinum group metals, so it will melt first and sink to the bottom of the molten mixture. Once the gold has melted, let the mixture cool down. Then tip the solid lump out and chip away the borax - you should have a solid blob of gold at the bottom. Or you can dissolve the borax away with water to isolate the gold.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"A couple of comments:

1. According to the MSDS sulfuric acid is not toxic nor harmful to the environment.

2. If you want the videos to be educational you should tell the amounts in moles, give theoretical yields and experimental yield percentages.

3. Your aspirin synthesis has a very low yield. You could try to explain why. You should also do some tests to show that the reaction has actually worked (such as TLC and staining with FeCl3)

4. When connecting the water tubes to a condenser, you should make the water flow upwards, not downwards as in your glacial acetic acid synthesis. This way even a slow flow will keep the condenser filled with water, maximizing the cooling effect. Although in this particular case the acetic acid will probably solidify if you have cold water running through the condenser all the time, but if you intentionally connected it that way you should explain why. Also, acetic acid is flammable, so using an open flame to heat the flask might not be the best idea (in general, using a bunsen burner in organic synthesis is not recommended). Again, you should give theoretical yields and test the product in some way.

5. In your synthesis of formic acid you should mention that methanol is toxic and that sodium hydroxide is corrosive.

"Most of what others have said here is accurate. You will likely need a degree in chemical engineering to become a chemical engineer. It'd be very unlikely you'd get a chemical engineering job if you're competing against others with an actual chemical engineering degree. 

I should say that chemical engineering is not very similar to chemistry at all. Think long and hard about what you are looking for. Chemical engineering will not automatically guarantee you a better paying job. Ask further questions at r/chemicalengineering, talk to professors (if possible), watch online lectures, read resources on the Internet, and be well-informed. The job market is mediocre for everyone, so only try to become a chemical engineer if you have a burning passion to become one. And I should say that very, very few people have such burning passion.

If you want to actually go through with it, you can get a B.S. in chemical engineering, but this will require a lot of time and money. I'd imagine it'd take close to 3 years at a US university even with your courses. This is because chemical engineering courses are offered in a strict sequence and usually only once a year even at the largest of schools. Each class builds on the last one, unlike in chemistry. The classes that overlap between chemical engineering and chemistry would be general chemistry, intro physics, physical chemistry, first-semester organic chemistry, and any math up to differential equations. That's about it. 

With that, you'd have to take an introductory process principles course, perhaps an *engineering* thermodynamics course (they are a bit different), two semesters of transport phenomena (i.e. fluid mechanics and heat/mass transfer), and reaction kinetics (this is very different in a chemical engineering context, as it is usually taught in the context of reactor design). Then, depending on the university, there are classes such as separations and process controls that you may need to take, among other classes like senior design courses that tie all the courses together. The B.S. in chemical engineering requires a *lot* of courses, even for a person with an M.S. in chemistry. There is really not a lot of similarity between the two fields at the undergraduate level as well as in the industry (except for R&amp;D). 

Another option is to apply for a M.S. program in chemical engineering. Some programs will accept chemistry students, but you'd likely need to be very clear about why you are desiring to get a second degree. Still, compared to peers in a M.S. chemical engineering program, you would certainly be far behind and would have to take some remedial classes to bring you up to speed. 

The transition is not easy, and you should truly know what you'd be getting into. Look a lot into process engineering, as this is what most undergraduate curricula are focused on.

"Well, the good news is, the job market for chemists is better than it is for biologists. The bad news is, you're not in as high demand as physicists, engineers, and mathematicians. I have seen very few exceptions in my experience, of people in your position getting a good job with the possibility of upward mobility without a PhD. And by your position, I mean with a pharmaceutical company (not sure where else organic chemists go). Some on here will tell you that they have a job or they know someone with a job with only a BA/BS but they're the exception, not the rule. So jobs are difficult to come by if you want to do organic synthesis.

On the other hand, if you want to go into other industries, then chemistry will give you the quantitative background that is attractive to them. Not as solid as physics or math, but definitely better than biology. 

Finally, before you enter graduate school, you better know why you're doing it. Most of the people I know in grad school now are here because they either 1) really want to go into academia (and those jobs are drying up now as universities are starting to hire more part-time lecturers) or 2) did a few years in industry and came back in order to get the coveted senior scientist or PI jobs in industry so they can move up in the company.

"I'll happily stand corrected about gamma radiation interacting with electrons - I had forgotten about Compton scattering. It has after all been 16 years since I was last in a Physics lab. I've edited my original post accordingly - do you still agree?

What I don't know is whether the Compton scattering effect from a pair of emitted gamma rays (I'm pretty sure that gamma decay always emits a pair, but do correct me if I'm mistaken) would have sufficient energy to rip a molecule apart. I suppose it depends on the size of the molecule and how many bonds there are to be broken. I'm guessing that a gamma ray could break one bond, maybe two or three - but how many more?

The bit about the minimum energy for a beta decay being 5% of light speed is just one of those weird facts that sticks in my brain from Physics lessons. Like the corresponding maximum energy for beta decay, which is 90% of light speed. Both were taught to me by my Physics professor.

The units for entropy are generally J/K or J/(K*mol). This may seem weird to you, ""how can disorder have units of energy/temperature?"" The reason I would say entropy has these units is because of how it was discovered.

Entropy was first discovered classically as heat flow/temperature. dS= dq/T Since energy and temperature already had units, it made sense to give units of entropy simply as the quotient of the two.

The biggest mistake one can make with such a bath is a poor preclean. The acid bath isn’t there to take gross residue off. It’s there to get off what wouldn’t come off with normal cleaning. The more the acid bath has to work to clean your glassware, the shorter the life of the bath will be. It can be very dangerous to put glassware containing lots of oxidizable material in an acid bath.

The amount of propane needed would be approximately the same as charcoal, by mass. Only the C of the propane is relevant, and it is mostly C.

(I'm not sure you said otherwise. Your original calculation was for filling the chamber once using charcoal.)

You're right, making the charcoal into dust may improve the efficiency. Especially if you mix the dust up, as with a tumbler, for example. (Careful it doesn't make it explosive.) 

I think it's fair that our concern has largely been the risk, not that we are sure it would fail.

Do you know of anyone doing this? Greenhouses are common enough; what's the inside story? have you googled for info on charcoal and CO? I did, some, and it is mainly emphasizing the risk. But I didn't dig.

"Some facets of ""patriarchy"" are closely related to gender roles throughout history. 

Just because an action comes from a woman doesn't mean she wasn't influenced by ""patriarchy."" Caroline Norton's actions, in my opinion, were considered feminist only because it fought the notion that children were inherently property of their fathers. It might have been considered a small step in the right direction at the time, but it still exhibits strong patriarchal influence in that it was based on the same patriarchal gender roles that it ended up enforcing.

&gt;The origins of patriarchy are closely related to the concept of gender roles, or the set of social and behavioral norms that are considered to be socially appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. Much work has been devoted to understanding why women are typically thought to inhabit a domestic role while men are expected to seek professional satisfaction outside of the home. This division of labor is frequently mapped onto a social hierarchy in which males' freedom to venture outside of the home and presumed control over women is perceived as superior and dominant. As such, rather than working to destablize the historical notion of patriarchy, much literature assess the origins of patriarchy, or a social system in which the male gender role acts as the primary authority figure central to social organization, and where fathers hold authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and entails female subordination.

"In order to get into a good graduate program and work for the PI you want, you'll maximize your chances by having research experience. I'm not talking about some 3 month summer thing that results in a poster session. I'm talking about something you've been committed to for a year or more and joining a lab group you actually contribute to (as opposed to cleaning glassware or being ""trained"" by running experiments that are not novel or interesting). The thing PIs value most in an incoming graduate student is the quality of their research experience (publications are definitely a plus, followed by poster presentations at conferences, etc.) and what their previous adviser says about them. 

Why, you ask? Well, because you're basically going to be working for your PI in graduate school for X amount of years - the most relevant work experience you bring in is your lab research experience. Transferable skills, as it were. And as an added bonus, you may even be able to use your adviser's connections to work for a specific PI you want in graduate school.

"I see your point about the vaccines. It is a complex issue. I think part of it is that for a long time there has been some presumed trust in Big X (whatever you want that X to be) that the products we were being sold were in our best interest, and that our regulatory bodies (FDA, USDA, etc) were thorough and unbiased. But it's no secret that there is a significant degree of lobbying from larger corporations in the regulatory process, which makes it hard to trust both the regulatory body's findings and the companies that appeal to them.

So I think this is where the appeal of these sorts of products come in - they are usually smaller companies, offering products that try to show as much transparency as possible in their processes and sourcing. While the sourcing and ingredients may or may not objectively be better for you, I think the big draw is the feeling of openness and transparency with what you're putting in/on your body. So I don't presume that this is a defense for chemophobia, I just think that chemophobia is an understandable side-effect of the recent loss of trust of the average consumer in large corporations and our government's ability to regulate in the interest of the consumer over the interest of the corpotation.",chemistry,2,1200.0

What makes you think that that dot is not just one solitary compound? If youre visualizing with UV, which of your two compounds do you think would be active. Just one? Both? There are also other ways to visualize amides. Ask your grad student about making some ninhydride.

In theory, yes. However, esterification reactions rarely ever go to 100% completion, since they are reversible. So you would still have some butyric acid left over.

"Some soaps leave a surfactant residue on the glassware, but it is usually removed by rinsing with tap water (hot water helps) and then DI or RO water, and rinsing with acetone afterwards. This is adequate for most lab needs. 

Honestly, if you rinse things out right after they are used (and so long as no caked-on material/grease is present), then half the time you don't even need soap - a light rinse with a solvent that dissolves whatever was in the glasswareand cleaning with acetone should be fine. 

If you intend to use glassware for making solutions for mass spectrometry, you had better not use soap at all (clean things immediately after use with multiple solvents).

"Aquariums. Keeping fish is easy. Keeping water is hard.

First thing you should do is deal with hardscaping. Trust me, it's easier when the tank is empty. If you want to add any kind of rock, go ahead, but you need to make sure the livestock will tolerate how it modifies the water. Fish from the Amazon, for example, live in slightly acidic soft water. On the other hand, African lake cichlids live in alkaline hard water. There are ways to encourage these water conditions though. Limestone can be added to encourage hard water, and, while there is no water softening rock I'm aware of, peat moss filtration can be used to encourage soft water.

Second thing you'll need to know is that you can't just throw fish in tap water. They will die, because tap water contains chlorine and/or chloramine to make it safe to drink. You'll need some kind of water conditioner if it uses chloramine - a popular one, [Seachem Prime](http://www.seachem.com/Products/product_pages/Prime.html), is a sodium thiosulfate solution - though chlorine will eventually dissipate into the atmosphere.

Third, you'll need to start cycling your tank. The nitrogen cycle is incredibly important here. Wastes release ammonia (poison), bacteria convert ammonia into nitrite (different poison), and different bacteria convert nitrite into nitrate (fertilizer). While nitrate is toxic in high concentrations (~50ppm IIRC), you do want some amount of it if you're keeping plants. Thanks to some ethical concerns (and those aside, it's just easier), you'll probably want to set up your bacteria colonies via [fishless cycling](http://www.fishkeeping.co.uk/articles_51/fishless-cycling-article.htm). Chemicals needed? A jug of ammonia. If you can't find ammonia, ammonium hydroxide is the exact same thing. Try for janitor's ammonia. That stuff doesn't have toxic surfactants, usually. Shake it, and if you see it foam, do NOT use that. Once you have that, you'll need to add ammonia to get the tank up to 4ppm (do the math yourself for bonus points), and throughout the next month, you'll need to keep feeding your bacteria delicious ammonia so they multiply. Once the bacteria can take you from 4ppm ammonia to 0ppm within 24 hours, it's cycled.

Fourth, add your fish. They don't like sudden changes in water chemistry, so you should add tank water over a period of an hour or so to acclimate them. Add the fish, but not the water (since pet store water is of questionable safety and cleanliness) and remember to feed them. Done!

Other things to keep in mind? Know which compounds contain copper if you're keeping invertebrates like shrimp and snails. Copper will kill them in very, very small quantities. Sadly, this metal is often found in fish medicine as well. If your home has copper pipes, it isn't usually a concern, but you might want to run the tap for a minute first and then use cool water, allowing it to warm to room temperature.

Plant fertilizers are another thing as well, but to be honest, I'm not that familiar with them. I believe iron is an important compound they need for photosynthesis, but I honestly can't remember. I have Java moss, and growing it is as simple as not actively trying to kill it. If you have a heavily planted tank, you might want to look into [CO2 injection](http://www.aquariumadvice.com/beginners-guide-to-co2-injection-in-the-planted-tank/). Get some yeast, some warm water, and some sugar, and stick it in a bottle (or use airsoft CO2 canisters, but that's less fun and more expensive). You'll want a valve to control the flow, and you'll want some kind of mechanism to dissolve the gas; bubbles are useless here. Just remember to turn it off at night. Both fish and plants have mitochondria (i.e. cellular respiration), using oxygen and releasing even more CO2, and the plants can't photosynthesize to offset that. There are some horror stories of people waking up to animals gasping at the surface because the CO2 rig ran through the night.

Keeping an aquarium is about making sure that your 5.0*10^1+/-1 gallon solution of organic and ionic compounds doesn't turn into poison. It's not that difficult if you know what you're doing and know the chemical and biological processes that go into it.",chemistry,40,1200.0
"&gt;The game you mention is a PC exclusive.

This makes no difference. My point is that it is in no way old news, and is no way hard to implement.

&gt;Monitors have had HDR for quite some time but not TVs.

Depends on what you mean by HDR. If you mean 32 bit color depth, yes and no. TVs have historically had some support for 32 bit color depth. Mine is a living example.

&gt;Consoles are made for TVs.

This is irrelevant. We are discussing AMD's plans to support HDR on their GPUs.

&gt;Consoles have the ability to process in 32 bit color but they DON'T USE 32b images because 95% of the TVs out there do not display it and the overhead is unreal.

I think a more likely reason is that calculating in a lower color depth is a very easy, hardly noticeable, way for them to increase performance. Most people playing on console wouldn't notice.

&gt;Any dev who works on consoles and wastes time with 32b color images is an idiot

It's not that hard to just change color depth for games. Hell DirectX can do it in a single function.

&gt;Some PC exclusives offer 32bit modes but most still don't use 32b images. We get our color depth from post processing.

Again; changing bit-depth isn't difficult in terms of calculation depth. The harder part would be converting textures, but even then, it is an industry standard to make textures larger than what you need anyway.

&gt;HDR and color depth are the same thing.

No it is not; at least, not what they are selling to you. They are selling to you factory-developed tone-mapping curves in-built into the display as well as deeper blacks. This sort of HDR is independent of any input single and as a result regardless of bit-depth.

&gt;HDR and color depth go hand in hand

In the same sense that dithering does, sure.

&gt;they are the same thing.

No they are not; again, in the context of the product they are trying to sell you. They are trying to sell you techniques they use to widen their display's contrast range.

&gt;Both Nvidia and AMD will soon be releasing cards powerful enough to run 4K 32b color in the 120 HZ range and monitors will start becoming available to reflect that.

Just barely. It will leave just under 200MBit/s of bandwidth to spare. Why is this a problem you're probably thinking. Shitty cables. If you're cable can't perfectly (or surpass) the DisplayPort 1.3 standard you're not gonna get that.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

"In principle, you are right. But it depends on the grade of filter paper used. A strong, coarse paper is less prone to doing this. But even if strands of paper do get trapped in the frit, they are easily removed. Just bake the frit in a hot oven, which dries out any paper strands. When dried, they shrink, so you can then remove them by blowing compressed air through the frit backwards.

I was persistently annoyed by the easy disintegration of lab grade filter paper - it becomes extremely weak once wet, especially around the folds. Since it is usually just a flat round disc, you have to fold it to fit it into a cone funnel. So I switched to using coffee filters from the supermarket instead. These are made thicker and keep their strength when wet. This is because they are made with raw, unbleached brown paper - bleaching paper to make it white also weakens it. The bonus prize is that coffee filters are already the correct shape to fit into a funnel, so no fiddly folding is required.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Uh oh. You may have missed something pretty big then. I'm afraid that momentum can be carried without mass. In this case it is given by the de Broglie relation: p = h*nu. A full explanation as to why this can be is perhaps a bit out of my league, but perhaps the easiest explanation as to why this must be can be seen from a two photon decay - if you imagine a positron and an electron decaying, the two must have been perfectly at rest if there is no momentum in the photons, otherwise momentum would not have been conserved. So either there is a missing particle, or anhilation is a forbidden reaction in practice - it turns out that each photon caries a piece of the original momentum, and this results in up to about a 3 degree variation in the angle the gamma's form (should be 180, but in practice varies a bit from 177 to 183). The de broglie relation really generalizes momentum rather than forms an esoteric definition - something with a wavelength must have momentum in this case, rather than the converse. As a side note, this implies that light by itself can carry not only energy, but ALSO momentum. Without this, lazer tweezers and solar sails would not work. Feel free to google lazer tweezer youtube videos if you would like some video proof that such things DO work in real life. :)

"A meta or ortho side product would have a very different 1H splitting pattern.  A close look at the splitting tree and trying to assign the 3JHH, 4JHH and (if you're lucky) 5JHH should easiliy help you differentiate between these different isomers.

Signals could overlap, sure.  Get the highest field strength spectra you can and hope it helps, or you can try a decoupling experiment (same time as running a simple 1H NMR) on a lower field spectrometer.

"How long do you need to leave a piece of silicon in the neutron flux of a reactor to dope it sufficiently with phosphorus? Because if it is too long, then you could end up with some pretty severe defects.

The materials science professor at the university I attended did his original research into defects introduced into the structure of graphite in the moderator blocks of a reactor core. Before that research, little was known about how the graphite changes when exposed to neutrons. Of course, it was expected that some of it would become radioactive, but then so does anything if you leave it exposed to neutron flux for long enough.

But it turns out that graphite ends up with all sorts of different crystal structure deformities and defects after being used as a moderator. Edge dislocations, screw dislocations, vacancy defects, interstitial defects, topological defects - more or less any kind of defect ever observed in a solid crystal can be observed in graphite is left exposed to neutron flux for sufficient time.

How many defects and which type predominates depends on the intensity of the neutron flux - whether the graphite was near the centre of the reactor core or near the edge - and the time it was exposed for. This can be different depending on where the graphite is positioned vertically in the core, because most reactors burn up their fissile isotopes steadily from the bottom upwards, as the control rods are gradually withdrawn from the core over several years.

So I would imagine that where exactly you position the pieces of silicon - its vertical position and horizontal distance from the core - would be critical for introducing the correct amount of phosphorus. It also depends on what varieties of crystal structure defects (and how many of them) can be tolerated in a semiconductor. I don't know the answer to this, but I bet it is not much.",chemistry,1,1200.0

I'm gonna start off trying to make a rudimental setup first, from the instructions from u/jlb8 and see if that works sufficiently.

"Base bath is great because it's a gold standard. It etches the glass so anything on it goes off with it. If you just have trace organics it's great to guarantee a clean piece of glass. If you have visible crud though odds are it won't work and you'll use an acid or oxidizer to deal with  the crud before the base bath. If you don't do a lot of synthesis just detergent is fine. 

Other washes are done to prepare for cleaning. Mainly to keep ehs happy. For example you use toluene and something in a round bottom. Rinse it out twice with toluene and twice with IPA. Alcohols are fine in a base bath so in it goes. Or if you want to clean with detergent if a bit of ipa goes in the drain it's not a problem.

The reason synthesis is special is because it's a pain in the ass. If you're just doing click fine, but if not who knows what effect a contaminant may have and God help you if it shows up in your nmr. 

Edit: If you use a base bath remember no calibrated glassware and no glass frits! Both will be ruined by the base bath. Graduate cylinders are ok to rinse in the base bath but can't be left or else you'll lose the marks.",chemistry,36,1200.0

"Do you mean you ran one in EtOH/H2O and the second in MeCN/H2O and those were different or you ran two sequential runs in MeCN/H2O and those were different? If the first scenario, obviously a difference in polarity of solvents causes the difference. If the second scenario, it could be a number of things. How do they look different? Do you see basically the same spectra, but with the peaks shifted? This can be caused by not starting with the same solvent mixtures or by inconsistent pressures. If you're using an Agilent or Waters HPLC, you can monitor the pressure to make sure it is consistent. You can also get weird baseline shifts if your column is going bad or if the lamp isn't calibrated properly. 

To answer how long to clear out the solvent, it's completely dependent on the column size and flow rate. If it's a small column (diameter less than 4.6mm), it should about 10 minutes with a flow rate of 1mL/min. Larger columns (diameter 10mm) can take 10-20 minutes with flow rate 3-5mL/min and obviously much longer with slower flow rates.  ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Great idea. Personally, I believe that peltier tiles are amazing tools that we could use to help create a greener future. To maximize energy output, you could try several things depending on what materials you have available to you. 
First of all, try connecting the peltier tiles in parallel. If the tiles are in series and you are not getting enough energy combined, you can try connecting in parallel so that the energy of each tile is independent of the other tiles.
Secondly, if you have the materials, you can try creating multiple joule thief circuits. A single joule thief may not be enough to boost three individual tiles. Several connected to the tiles may do the trick, but it would be difficult to make. You may also want to first try increasing the size if the toroid. A larger toroid ring will produce a larger magnetic field which will in turn increase the output. (You should read up on toroids).

Not all the copper was oxidized (losing it's electrons) to allow it to bond with the (very small amount) of acetate anions present. Acetic acid itself is a weak acid so dissociating in water, very few protons are going to drive off to form hydronium ions with the water. 

The hydrogen peroxide is present to help drive oxidation?

I would look into the professors at each school to see who you're interested in, but keep an open mind. There should be a poster session on the first night or morning where grad students from the groups will show their work, talk to a lot of people and look around, you may find an interest that you didn't know before.

"In the bowels of Pebble Science, the water had risen to a level about eight feet above the very lowest slab floor. The subsubbasement was an indoor pond.
Stored papers, equipment – ruined. Glassware was not damaged, but the moving waters had saturated and mechanically destroyed all cardboard boxes, so much of the glassware had filled and sunk to the bottom of the flood - where it would inevitably be crushed by the cleanup operation. It was a mess, but not on the same order as the disaster to be found in the chemical morgue. There, most of the jars and bottles remained sealed. Each according to its volume and weight of remaining content either bobbed on top of the water, lay sunken on the bottom, or rode in an eerie equilibrium somewhere in between. The rusting metal shelving had tumbled down like dominoes. The surface of the flood was dimpled with the rounded shapes of the containers, like apples in a tub, and was also slowly becoming slimed by labels. The paper identifiers glued to the collection of glass bottles and metal tins succumbed to the water after a time and separated from their containers so that after only a few hours most of the chemicals were anonymous. Solvents, sorbents, acids, bases, esters, nitriles, phenols, halides, complex molecules, simple salts, reactive metals – members of almost every type of product commercially available from the chemical manufacturing industry for the last fifty years and more tumbled slowly together in the murky well that the morgue had become. They were apart for now, but time was against them. Some of the lids sealed against
the glass rim of their bottles using a simple waxed cardboard insert. In a while, hours perhaps, the patient water would permeate this barrier. Oils would seep out. Salts would dissolve. Acids and bases would react. Solvents not miscible with the flood waters would either rise to the surface or sink to seek out the lowest hollows in the floor, depending on their specific gravities. The most well-sealed containers in the stew held the most dangerous cargo – the clumps of sodium and potassium metal, sodium borohydride, potassium hydride, lithium aluminum hydride. These were generally in jars whose lids were metal, sealed with a rubbery ring, and would withstand the water better. But it would only take one of those jars to break, to have a poorly-sealed lid haphazardly screwed down decades before, to have a pinhole where rust had been slowly working at the thin metal of the lid, before catastrophe visited the lonely morgue. Then hydrogen gas would be generated. It would mix with the fumes of benzene and toluene and hexane and pentane in this sealed space. Perhaps it would find a vent, waft out holes in the ceiling. Perhaps enough of it would accumulate, and it would ignite in such an accidentally favorable ratio of oxygen to fuel that detonation would follow with force sufficient to crack the concrete above and destroy the iron backbone of Pebble Science.

"I really like this one: Create a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide, filter out the solid, then titrate it with a calibrated strong acid solution to find the hydroxide concentration. You use this to calculate the Ksp of calcium hydroxide at a specific temperature. Now do all this again at a higher temperature (the Ksp actually decreases as you increase T).

-
With two Ksp's at two temperatures you can calculate the the delta G, delta H, and delta S of this process. I love this because you indirectly calculate something fundamental from a rather mundane measurement, which I think better represents the types of experiments and results scientists actually pursue.

-
Here is the kicker. Calculating the Ksp's from concentration alone gives really poor results. To get it right you have to calculate Ksp with activities. This adds a whole other level of detail to the calculations and discussion of the results.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"In principle, this is a great idea, since it could convert more or less any heat source into electricity. However, there is a snag, which is that creating electricity by the thermoelectric effect (thermocouple) is rather inefficient. That doesn't make it useless though - it just requires a lot of heat to generate a decent amount of power.

The efficiency is dependent on the temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink. The temperature difference between the human body and the surrounding air is not all that much (about 30 ^o C on a cold day), so a thermocouple used in this context isn't going to produce a lot of power. If you live in a very cold climate, then the temperature difference would be greater, pushing the efficiency up a bit. 

Sometimes you don't need efficiency so much as reliability, and this is where a thermoelectric generator is extremely useful. For example, deep space instruments (such as the Voyager and Cassini probes) use this effect for power. In those probes, a chunk of plutonium-238 is the heat source and space itself is the heat sink. In that context, the temperature difference can be hundreds of ^o C, making this a practical and useful long term power source for spacecraft.

There are other applications exploiting the same effect. One particularly effective example is that which fits over a [kerosene lamp](http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/thermoelectric/russlamp1a.jpg). This was used mainly in Siberia in the 1950s and 1960s as an electricity source for low power devices such as radios.

"That reaction is a partial oxidation, which is like a partial combustion. It has a reaction enthalpy of -71 kJ/mol, which is almost as high as the full combustion of methane in oxygen (-80 kJ/mol), so you'd expect it to be possible, at least thermodynamically. You'd have to carefully control the feed of oxygen to prevent it from fully combusting, though. I didn't find out much about it, but it looks like it needs a catalyst and high temperatures. Google CPOX to find out more.  


Another comment mentioned steam reforming - this is a widely used method of synthesizing hydrogen, but it requires large amounts of energy, high temperatures (&gt;700 C) and a catalyst. Reaction heat is 21 kJ/mol, so you need to add heat to keep the reaction going.


Another reaction that might be helpful for you is the water gas shift. CO + H2O &lt;-&gt; CO2 + H2. Reaction heat = -41 kj/mol. This reaction is an equilibrium reaction, so products or reactants are favored at different conditions. The reaction conditions aren't as extreme as the above reactions.


If you're just trying to make hydrogen on earth to take with you to mars, these reactions could work, but the reaction conditions (especially for the first two) might make them impractical on your spacecraft. If you wanted to make hydrogen on your spacecraft, you could use solar panels to make electricity and then use the electricity to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen. Water has the advantage over methane of being an easier, safer and denser way to store hydrogen. Hydrogen can also be used to run fuel cells to create electricity, essentially the reverse of above.


Another way to store hydrogen is as methanol, which can be created via the methane to methanol process, using steam reforming and the water gas shift reactions, followed by a methanol synthesis. The synthesis reaction doesn't need high temperatures (250 C) but it requires very high pressure. Methanol can be used for other reactions, and it can also be used as combustion fuel or in fuel cells.

"I got an MS at around the same point in my career as you're at now. It was a good experience (other than dealing with my PI), it opens a few doors, and I'm taken a little bit more seriously. If you can snag a job that requires an MS, I think it's worth the relatively small amount of time and debt it takes to get one. Based on the jump in salary before and after the MS, my degree paid for itself after about 2-3 years. 

However, if you're in a good situation with your current job and you think there's room to grow there, I'd stick around. The degree is a nice box to check off if it's convenient, but I feel like it's not that much more valuable than two years of work experience where you're learning new things. I was in a low paying dead-end technician job where I was at the point where I wasn't going to learn much more, so I wasn't giving up that much by going back to school.

"Thanks for the clarification! It truly is a good one!

I think my initial comment about ""the way I see things"" wasn't meant to be pragmatic at all. Just the opposite, it was meant to be my view on a hypothetical idealistic society. And I agree, this by no means a pragmatic viewpoint, just a belief. 

However, more to your point. I think that given the three options you provided I would lean towards choosing #1. That having been said, do not think that my views fit into these categories. For instance, though many of my views are in line with socialism, I often find myself at (slight) odds with other colleagues and friends that also have socialist views. I have NO IDEA how to get from ""here"" to ""there"", I just see the ""there"" (an idealistic society) and it looks so beautiful! I see so much potential in my mind, but then I look around and see patents that prevent widespread access of life-saving medication. Just in the realm of research, there are duplicated efforts because people keep things secret for reasons concerning money. It's a shame. I don't like the concept of patents and intellectual property. Art, science, discoveries, etc... should just be things that are produced by people that benefit everyone! I don't see this as dominance at all? Who is being dominated in this idealistic scenario?

Now, on the other hand, when put in perspective of actual pragmatic issues, you are entirely correct. By ending capitalism/industries/etc... there is a dominance there, where some (in this case me) want to insert this way of living over another. So I guess the act of societal reform is a dominant act, regardless of the outcome! This was kind of eye opening for me, so thanks for sharing that! Again, I'm not so sure about any actual action, I just like talking idealistically (as unproductive as that may be).

You last question is excellent! ""So you believe that the strong should be free to oppress the weak?"" I really like this question because I find in extremely hard to answer. But I'll give it a shot. I think in an idealistic society we would all be strong! Moreover, I think there wouldn't be the same necessity/desire/motivation to oppress anyone! Everyone would be well off and happy and free to do as they please! And in this scenario, I just can't see anyone wanting to ""oppress"" someone else. So although that doesn't directly answer the question, I think you can see where I'm coming from at least.

Now, I'm off to get drunk and watch sports with friends! Still many things I love about life in the society we live in! Thank you for your time good sir! you have made me think about things in a new light, which is one of my favorite things to do!
Cheers!

"I got a 52/60 and took the national exam a few months after the local. I believe the AP Chem curriculum covers the Olympiad quite well. (I took both IB HL Chem AP Chem exams while being a IB student.)

The National exam however is a lot more challenging. For this I suggest buying a AP Chem (if you havent already) practice book and working through it. The questions and material between the National and AP Chem exam are very similar. The National exam has a lab component which was composed of two experiments. You are given access to a lab and distributed limited glassware. If I remember correctly, you are given pieces of paper that list what you can use, an answer line, and a blank space to write procedure/calculations. 

The first one was determine the concentration of chloride ions in sea water using silver salt(nitrate?). The second one was the synthesis of a inorganic complex.

Be very careful. Use cold water, because dissolving NaOH generates heat. The solution is corrosive to any part of your body.

I guess I was very fortunate, I have a background in Chemistry. I never finished my degree because although I love chemistry I could not picture myself in a strict lab ruining my passion for the rest of my life. After getting a couple of odd jobs I began doing pyrotechnics in Hollywood, they liked my background in chemistry that relates directly to that field of special effects. After several years of doing pyrotechnics, fireworks, flame effects, etc. I got my licenses to do special effects, in the U.S this is what matters not school.
The best part is the ingenuity and different jobs you get to do, no one day is the same. I definitely had to learn so many more skills when doing special effects. But I always kept a heavy concentration with the pyrotechnic side of it, but welding, carpentry, plumbing, engineering, drafting, scheduling, legality and so many more skills have to be picked up quickly or you're left behind in an incredibly fast moving environment.

The 212 evo fan is pretty good yes.

A Noctua NF F12 would be the best replacement, but you don't need to spend $20 if you don't want to.

Noctua P12 would be fine.

Phanteks PH-F120MP would be ok.


Just needs to be a radiator fan, an SP120 from Corsair would be fine too although I don't particularly like those.

you should be able to RMA the fan with Cooler Master anyway if it's under warranty, but obviously you'd still need a new one unless you didn't use the pc for weeks while it's replaced. 


&gt;i thought the cm hyper 212 evo was the best cheap fan around?

Hang on, the 212 evo is not a fan, that's a heatsink. The fan is a separate part that just clips off, you take the broken fan off, take off the mounting brackets at either side and attach them to the new fan then just slot the new fan onto the 212 EVO and you're done.

Just needs to be a static pressure radiator fan, so not a Corsair AF fan or any other airflow fan - those are terrible for heatsinks.

"That doesn't sound quite right.  Just because the hydrogen might not be explicitly dashed so that it's behind the plane, it doesn't mean that the hydrogen wouldn't be behind the plane.  If a tetrahedral shape has two lines in the plane, then a third substituent must come toward you, and a fourth must go behind the plane.  This question is a good example of it: carbon 5 has one in-plane line to carbon 6, one in-plane line to carbon 4, and one wedge to toward-you chlorine, meaning that the last substituent is hydrogen and must be behind the plane of the page.  As such, it's already being held away from you, so there's no reason to assign then flip (R to S or S to R).  If you flip your R/S assignment because the orientation isn't specified (the reason that you give), then you're still forcing an orientation by assigning it R or S in the first place, and then forcing a different orientation by changing the assignment.  If there are three in-plane lines and no specified hydrogen, then it would have to imply a racemic mixture, and if there are two in-plane lines and one wedged or dashed substituent, then it already implies that the fourth substituent (which would have to be hydrogen, as it wasn't specified) is the opposite: dashed or wedged, respectively.

Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your statement, that is.  But the only time (that I can think of) that you should flip the R/S assignment is if the lowest-priority group is either explicitly coming out of the plane toward you, or if it's an unmarked hydrogen that would be coming out of the plane toward you due to the arrangement of the marked substituents.",chemistry,3,1200.0

"It's kind of a confusion of the issue of nuclear stability - an 'element' is stable if its nucleus is.  Feynman was talking about the stability of a neutral 'bound state' between the nucleus and electrons.  But a nucleus can exist without being bound to a number of electrons equal to its charge - we simply call it an 'ion'.  

There are examples from real chemistry of known, stable elements:  ammonium.  NH*_4_*^+ acts a lot like a Group 1 cation.  People actually tried to reduce it, to add one more electron to it in order to get ammonium metal, analogous to sodium or potassium metal.  It never worked, it would just decompose it.  For a while people believed that neutral ammonium existed as a solution in mercury, ""ammonium amalgam"", but this substance turned out to be a ammine-hydrido complex.  A basic Lewis structure of NH*_4_*^+ is sufficient to show why:  nitrogen has a full octet and the hydrogens all have 2 valence electrons, there is simply nowhere to put another electron.

Similarly, a superheavy element which could not bind enough electrons to form a neutral atom due to relativistic effects would still be observable as a positive ion.

The same is true for sulfate and bisulfate.

If accuracy had been better, then the existence of the additional atomic mass unit from the hydrogen in the bicarbonate ion would have been noted. Then, perhaps the names of these compounds would have been swapped compared to what they are now.
When it comes to bicarbonate or bisulfate salts of the alkaline earth (group 2) metals, these names are then more accurate. Calcium carbonate is CaCO*_3_*, but calcium bicarbonate is Ca(HCO*_3_*)*_2_*, which really does have twice the amount of carbonate compared to calcium.",chemistry,3,1200.0

"I would say it is highly improbable with the consideration of the bonding components of the allyl ligand. Let's consider the allyl ligand (or we can helpfully refer to the other name; 'enyl' ligand) as having two simultaneous modes of bonding in its η^3 mode: there's the 'ene' part - the η^2 double bond motif, and the 'yl' part - the η^1 'alkyl' motif. Be aware that the η^3 bonding mode of the allyl ligand is of course best described as a delocalised system with three π molecular orbitals of metal d orbitals of appropriate symmetry and energy, but this is a useful model in this context:

Presumably you have already come across the η^1 coordination mode often manifested by the allyl ligand. η^3 to η^1 'haptotropic shifts' (the special name we give this transformation) are common in the chemistry of the allyl ligand. This is because we can imagine the 'ene' part (the η^2 double bond motif) to be more weakly bound - this may become dissociated to allow another ligand to take its place. This is because a free alkene is relatively happy to be dissocated from the metal - it was not that strongly bound in the first place. Conversely, if we imagine the η^1 'alkyl' part to dissociate while the 'ene' η^2 double bond part stays attached, then the dissociated alkyl motif must bear a negative charge, leaving a positive charge on the metal. It simply isn't happy about this - the 'alkyl' component of the η^3 allyl ligand is too strongly bound to the metal centre.

If we forget the allyl ligand for a moment and think individually about an alkyl ligand and an olefin (alkene) ligand bound to a metal centre to form an organometallic complex: You may indeed have heard of alkene ligands being able to associate and dissociate readily - they are relatively weakly bound. However you probably haven't heard too much of alkyl ligands simply 'falling off' - they are much more strongly bound since a free alkyl ligand bears a formal negative charge; this is unfavourable. A better way of looking at it is that the orbital that bears the negative charge on the alkyl ligand (also the one that donates into the metal orbitals) is much higher in energy than the π orbital on the alkene, and is therefore much happier coordinated to the respective metal d orbital (and hence forms a stronger metal-ligand bond).

I hope this made some sense; essentially imagine that there are two features of bonding present in the η^3 allyl ligand; the η^1 alkyl part being much more strongly bound than the η^2 alkene part, therefore the latter may dissociate far more readily to afford the well known 'η^1 - allyl bonding mode', as opposed to the (to my knowledge) unknown 'η^2 - allyl bonding mode' that you propose.

"That was a 3rd party not AMD. They wanted hardware from AMD so they could try to modify drivers to get it to work.

&gt;The team sought support from AMD in the form of a Radeon HD4800 series sample, so they could work out a similar solution for it, but AMD rejected it telling it wasn't a venture worth investing product samples and PR information on, clearly a case of them downplaying the issue to evade possible action from NVIDIA on supporting the use of its proprietary technologies in violation of license agreements. After being denied support from a company they were banking the most on, they were left to their own plight against NVIDIA who have a history of an aggressive business model, even more so after it was known NGOHQ.com may have reverse engineered drivers, a clear violation of the EULA. 

So AMD and NVIDIA didn't have licencing, and a 3rd party wanted to do it anyway and wanted AMD to provide hardware and support.

From the source:

&gt;
The bad news is we still don’t have access to any HD 4800 hardware yet. It is very important for this project to receive AMD’s support on both developer and PR levels. It seems that AMD still is not being cooperative, we get the feeling that they want this project to fail. Perhaps their plans are to strangle PhysX since AMD and Intel have Havok. We truly hope this is not the case since “format wars” are really bad for the consumers (For example: Blu-ray vs. HD-DVD).

&gt;Before we get to the good news, I’m going to ask you to hold on to something steady as some of you are going to feel a bit dizzy after you hear this. The truth is… Nvidia is now helping us with the project and it seems they are giving us their blessings. It’s very impressive, inspiring and motivating to see Nvidia's view on this. Why they help us? My best guess would be: They probably want to take on Intel with CUDA and to deal with the latest Havok threat from both AMD and Intel.

"&gt;""it's only first quarter-- most people don't do as well.""

I was about to write something similar. After my first semester I wanted to quit because I was overwhelmed by the new situation. Back in school I had to listen to the teaches in class and that was enough to pass the tests. Now I all of the sudden had to actually work and learn even after classes and I didn't pass my basic chemistry exam. I then went to tutoring classes and started working harder. The next time I passed the basic chemistry exam with the best results this day. 

&gt;In high school, people usually told me that I was very smart just because I took advanced courses but I did not really feel comfortable hearing the word ""smart"" because I was not particularly smart at all because I just over-studied and stressed over exams many nights in order to keep up with my GPA.

I know that feel, after the first semester fear became my biggest motivation to work harder (probably smarter too because there are a lot of guys working harder than me with not so great results) and today the good grades just keep on coming and I'm tutoring people myself. With all the good grades I gained much confidence and I'm glad I didn't quit.
I still haven't majored though, but I now know that it's possible for me to do it. Because of the first one/two semesters I was questioning myself and now I'm a year behind with most people I started studying with now majoring. That's ok. I think it was of biggest importance to realize I'm able to study succesfully.
If you have a hard time I would suggest you take one step at a time if the current load is too much for you. I didn't attend all classes I was supposed to and concentrated on fewer classes to pass fewer exams but with greater success. I kept telling myself to take my time in order to build up a greater foundation and I'm pretty happy about the way it is right now.

"To answer the first question: The energy involved in a typical radioactive decay event is easily enough to break all the bonds in a molecule. Whether that will actually happen depends on the type of radiation emitted. Gamma radiation is purely electromagnetic, so has no mass, therefore its emission does not impart any momentum to the nucleus it is emitted from. But then again, gamma decay doesn't usually involve a change in atomic number.

What is relevant is alpha or beta decay (or inverse beta decay - positron emission). In those, an actual particle with real mass is emitted at high speed - the minimum energy for a beta decay sends the resulting electron flying out of the nucleus at 5% of light speed, and most decay events are much more energetic than that.

Alpha particles travel more slowly, but have far greater mass, since they are essentially helium nuclei. So with a decay emitting either an alpha or beta particle, the nucleus experiences significant recoil from the emitted particle. This sends the nucleus bouncing off in the opposite direction. Much slower of course, since most nuclei are many times heavier than the particles emitted. But still fast enough to be bounced out of whatever molecule they were a part of, which effectively breaks whatever bonds they had been making.

Of course, when it comes to rest (by bouncing off other atoms and slowing down), it will form bonds with whatever it is nearest to. If part of a bulk solid (like an oxide), then those bonds will of course be to oxygen. It will only be able to make a stable number of bonds, so if that means bonding with fewer oxygens, then there will be some oxygen atoms going spare within the solid. What happens to these is not entirely certain, but presumably they eventually join up with each other and diffuse out of the bulk solid as oxygen gas.

Where this gets really interesting and complicated is if the radioactive isotope is part of a small molecule. The smallest such example would be water containing one tritium atom - 3H-O-H. Tritium decays by beta particle emission to become helium-3, which cannot bond with anything. So this would produce a hydroxyl radical, which would bounce around until it met up with another radical to quench itself with.

A more complex example is [fluorinated glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_%2818F%29) containing an atom of fluorine-18, which is used in PET scans. The fluorine-18 emits a positron (a proton becomes a neutron) and becomes oxygen-18. This can then pick up a proton from its environment and become normal glucose. This is useful because the fluorinated glucose cannot be metabolised until the decay occurs, so it has a chance to be distributed throughout the body and release positrons wherever glucose is required to be.",chemistry,21,1200.0

"A liquid boils when its partial pressure equals the total pressure. Raoult's law tell you that the partial pressure of a substance is equal to its molar fraction in the liquid phase multiplied by its saturation pressure, which is a function of temperature (Pa = ya P^sat). When you have a pure liquid, ya = 1 therefore Pa = P^sat. If it has an impurity, like salt, ya &lt; 1 therefore Pa &lt; P^sat, so when the water-salt mixture achieves 100ºC it is indeed true that P^sat = Ptotal yet Pa &lt; Ptotal. You need a little ""extra"" temperature increase to make Pa = Ptotal and that extra is proportional to (1-ya), which is the molar fraction of the salt. Of course, non-idealities may play a role here and Raoult's law doesn't strictly apply, however the reasoning would be equivalent even if we considered a non-ideal mixture.",chemistry,3,1200.0

"Have you tried writing down the rate equation for the overall reaction?

So the second step is the rds (for simplicity, let's assume this step is irreversible), so we get:

- r = r2 = k2[FFAH][MeOH]

To get the actual rate we need the concentration of the protonated acid, which can be obtained from the equilibrium of the first reaction:

- K = [FFAH]/([FFA][H]) which we can rearrange to [FFAH] = K[FFA][H]

Now the rate becomes:

- r2 = k2K[MeOH][FFA][H]

This is a special case where the second step is the rds. If the first step would be slow and the second one fast, the rate would simply be:

"Generally speaking the properties of a block copolymer and a mixture of two different polymers should be different. One thing to consider is (depending on your monomers) to seperate the block copolymers from the homopolymers before analysis, so that you are sure you're not dealing with a mixture.

However, that's not an answer to the question. Depending on what you have, CD/LD techniques could give some insight to the structure of the polymer. Another thing to use would be AFM or SEM/TEM depending on what kind of properties you're expecting to see. For example, seperate blocks could aggregate while the block copolymer will not. 

No doubt there will be some fancy sensitive NMR techniques. Again, depending on the properties you could make use of diffusion coefficient studies or mobility/dynamics studies. But this assumes you have a frame of reference. ",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Most schools will reimburse you-if they're even in top 30, I wouldn't worry about money. Just make sure to save receipts for travel or count miles for if you're driving and they ask you to turn in forms. Others will just set up your travel/accommodations/etc. If you go during the visitation weekend, you shouldn't have to really worry about too much of the planning process-that's their way of reeling you in and showering you with gifts before signing away your next 5 years. If you're still not sure, just ask. There are ppl dedicated to the visitation weekends in the department at each university. Their info should have been included in some correspondence.

As far as preparation, I'd suggest looking at multiple professors in each program for which you're interested by reading their literature. If you can't find a couple, I might suggest going to a visitation weekend where you can, especially if there is a conflict. There are always little intricacies outsiders don't know about and you can have rude awakenings when you get to a weekend to learn the one professor you were interested in is a major dick, doesn't take students anymore, may be moving, etc. Be open-minded too in terms of learning what's going on in the department and what different professors have to offer. A website or paper in JACS isn't the whole story.

With all that being said, if you really like the schools and the professors who have contacted you, schedule the weekend. Contact students in their respective group and ask what life, research, group dynamic, is like. 

Most importantly though, if you go to a weekend and are even remotely considering that school, do NOT hesitate to ask questions even if you think you'll hurt feelings or it may come off as rude! I can't stress how important that is. You're going to spend the next 5 years of your life working long hours for a professor and with the people you meet at the visitation weekend. It's totally OK to ask about funding situations in a professors lab and how much they expect you to teach, work in lab/week. If someone gets offended, there is usually something to hide, but no program or group is ever perfect either. Just soak up everything you possibly can, it's going to shape a lot of your future and knowing at the beginning is much better than 3 yrs in.",chemistry,10,1200.0

When you get accepted, it'll be just like before. You'll reply by April 15th, and then you'll enroll. You'll leave your current institution as if nothing ever happened. Make sure to find out from your first institution when your funding will end. You don't want to suddenly be without a paycheck without any plan in mind. 

If you wish to apply to programs you got into before, I recommend emailing any professor you spoke to there and/or the person on the graduate admissions committee. This will make your application seem like less of a surprise when the committee reads it. I know for a fact this expedited when I heard back. Some of the universities offered to pay for my visiting weekend again, although one didn't. And for the new universities I applied to, it was if I was applying as an undergraduate again. 

So, in short, you'll basically be applying again just like before but will have to list that you are currently attending a graduate program and include a short section in your statement of purpose about why you're leaving.",chemistry,3,1200.0

You get cross-ring splitting between protons that separated by a carbon (i.e one is in a meta position to another). 
Thats why I suggested that if you had a product that was substituted in the para positions, you'd get this 'roof-top' effect from the cross-ring splitting rather than more peaks etc if your product had other substitutions.

"I think what a certain academic/postdoc thinks is the right way (ie the cleaning ""gold standard"") depends on what they are used to.

When doing my mchem project we only ever used an acetone rinse then in the oven it went and I never had any problems with that, although I found everyone built up a big pile of glassware they needed to wash up. Nowadays everything goes through the Base bath then acid bath then acetone rinse (unless it's a beaker or something that obviously isn't that dirty) because that's my supervisor's preference. However a lot of my reactions leave behind traces of gunk that just won't shift with acetone so a soak in the base bath is a necessary procedure (unless there's a lot, in which case nitric acid or aqua regia is used).

"I would absolutely carry a firearm at work.

...but I already carry a concealed firearm, in the US, when and where I am allowed. I have defensive handgun training, and practice with my handgun. I'm not a teacher, but I would carry regardless of my occupation.

My wife teaches at a public elementary school. I'd be fine with her and other teachers carrying a concealed handgun *on them at all times*. No leaving it in the purse or desk, where a kid could find it or where it won't do you any good should a life threatening situation occur. Extensive training would have to be required, teachers should be able to choose if they want to carry or not, and they would have to be fully responsible for their firearm.

Also, this doesn't mean that if someone were to begin shooting people in a school, the teachers who are carrying should put themselves or students at risk to stop the attack. If it makes more sense to evacuate the kids safely, do that, you don't necessarily have to engage the threat.

It would be a ton of training and policy to implement a program to get teachers to carry in a school; but if done right, it would be more effective at stopping or deterring the school shootings we see in the US, than what schools currently do (lock the doors and hide - though this is effective).

"The amount of current you need for electroplating depends on the rate at which you want to build up a layer of metal on the substrate. This is because the rate of reaction is directly dependent on the current flowing. However, you don't want to electroplate at a high rate, since that tends to cause the plating to form in a powdery or granular irregular layer which doesn't stick properly.

The current flow depends on several factors: The voltage applied, the surface area of the electrodes, the distance between them and the concentration of the electrolyte.

The higher the electrolyte concentration, the lower the resistance will be, so the higher the current will be for any given voltage. Increasing the distance between the electrodes will increase the resistance, therefore decreasing the current. Larger electrodes have a higher surface area, allowing more current to flow. Finally, higher voltages will cause higher current flow, though only up to the maximum possible rate of ion movement through the electrolyte, which is limited by the electrolyte concentration.

So you don't need a particularly high voltage. 20 volts is way too much - 6 volts is enough for most purposes. Though if you keep the electrolyte concentration low enough, you can get away with using 12 volts. Also, 30 amps is extremely optimistic - even with a saturated solution of copper sulfate, you won't be able to push much more than half that through the solution, not that a rate that high would result in a quality layer forming anyway.

So a power supply capable of between 6 and 12 volts would be sufficient. You don't want to be pushing more than a couple of amps, or less for small electrodes. So a low wattage supply is fine. If you use a transformer rated for a 110 volt (USA) mains supply on a 220 volt outlet, the output DC voltage will be doubled. However, the current will also be doubled, which could overload the rectifier or blow internal fuses, so this is not recommended.

Lots of people doing electroplating use a car battery charger as the power supply, or a car battery itself is also fine. An old computer power supply is also a cheap alternative, since you can salvage one from a junkyard for free. These have a 12 volt and 5 volt output, so you could use either.

To answer your other questions:

(1). Brass is a perfectly good conductor on its own, so it should not be necessary to put any kind of coating on it before plating it with another metal. Just make sure the surface is completely free of dirt, grease or corrosion.

(2). For plating with copper, a solution of copper sulfate alone is sufficient. You don't need to add sulfuric acid. The piece you want to plate to should be the negative electrode, with a piece of pure copper as the positive electrode.

(3). The purity of the copper anode is not drastically important - the main impurities in copper are silver and platinum group metals, which are not particularly soluble. However, the purity of the electrolyte is more important. I wouldn't necessarily trust agricultural grade copper sulfate to be pure enough. I would suggest looking on Ebay or Amazon for a better supplier. Copper sulfate is not on any dangerous chemicals watch list, so buying it online is perfectly legal.

(4). Agitation is not strictly necessary - the ion flow between the electrodes does a reasonably good job of mixing the electrolyte. Over time, the electrolyte will heat up, even if you start with it cold, so the convection currents caused by the heating effect will also contribute to mixing.

With respect to your experiment with a silver plated ring, there are some possible ways that metal could have been eaten away from the ring. Firstly, if the electrolyte was significantly acidic, which it wouldn't have been if you only used copper sulfate. Secondly, if you accidentally connected the battery the wrong way round. With metal transfer electroplating, metal is always dissolved from the positive electrode, never from the negative. Another possibility is if there was a scratch in the silver plating and the underlying metal was more electropositive (more reactive) than copper, such as iron. That would cause the underlying metal to slowly dissolve even without any current flowing.",chemistry,3,1200.0

Dissolution is difficult when you have large pellets of the polymers instead of fine powders. I have two suggestions one is easy the other depends on your access to machine and instrumentation. 
1. melt the polymer pellets at 150C in a vial under argon or dry nitrogen. At 150C just take the vial and drop it into a dewer containing liquid nitrogen. This process shall quench the polymer and freeze it at an amorphous state below the glass transition. Take out the vial and after allowing it to warm up a bit (to avoid thermal shock in glass vial) add hot xylene into the vial. Since the polymer is amorphous now, the extra energy to break down crystals is not needed and the polymer easily goes into solution. If the solution is constantly agitated there are no local concentration gradient and thus supporting dissolution. This is a general method for dissolving crystalline polymers. The time taken will be less than 20 mins.

Don't solely focus on research Universities as an undergraduate though. There are a lot of smaller schools with good departments and faculty that will be focused on undergrad teaching rather than chasing the next zillion dollar NIH grant.

Your situation IS fairly unique (international, undergraduate transfer) so I'd suggest coming up with a shortlist of schools and making some phone calls. Ask about things like admissions (testing and transcripts),transfer credits, etc. to make sure they won't give you problems.

"Done a few hiring of PIs for Organic Synthesis. All these are excellent. Also include a research summary, and please go over this with a fine tooth comb. Treat it as a fellowship application so no more than 3 pages for a total synthesis. Don't add superfluous reactions. We don't need a fluffer.

Apply everywhere and anywhere. Larger companies where I am at tend to take around a month or so until we start doing phone calls so don't be discouraged. We get ~300 applications, it's a lot to go through. BUT because we go through so much, we tend to lean on the familiar, so network. We tend to talk to professors we invite for lectures for any post-docs or new grads that may be qualified. They also drop us names that they met at so-and-so time as well.

For your research talk: practice, practice, practice. Don't go overboard with figures, it sometimes helps that you talk about it. Also talk about any problems you had, why something didn't work and how you fixed it, and know WHY it works. You can say you fixed something, not know why but only because your PI said so. REALLY bad. Doesn't matter if you were on one project or five, but you are fully 100% knowledgeable behind ALL the chemistry. We had one guy who did a post-doc at Scripps, and did a lot of med chem for graduate school. His work was impressive, but he failed to explain why certain reactions worked. For example why 5 eqvs of base was useful as opposed to just 2. He didn't get the position. 

Oh, and don't forget to acknowledge previous work that has been done whether in your lab or outside. We turned down an applicant that was adamant a certain Lewis Acid catalyzed transformation was hers and hers alone when one of our co-workers had done the same transformation five years ago. It is a very dick move, and tells us that you don't play well with others.  

Know the companies you were invited for an in-person interview for. You usually talk with four of us one-on-one throughout the day. We love you to ask questions. Some people just do all the talking but we stop to see if you have any questions. 

Just hired a new PI a couple months ago. We were slated to hire five more, but seeing as we are one the global companies that merged, that won't be happening anytime soon. I would suggest not to apply to either until the end of 2016. Sorry. It sucks for us too. ",chemistry,15,1200.0

"I'm trying to make 3-nitroindole from indole.  Since mixed-acid nitration doesn't work well for indole, there are many other approaches.

One procedure reported a ~91% yield from refluxing AgNO*_3_*, NBS, and indole in acetonitrile, but they don't really mention how long to reflux the AgNO*_3_* and NBS for before adding the indole, so I added it rather quickly and got pretty much no yield.  I tried it again, waiting about five minutes before adding the indole, but I still got nothing.

I switched to a different procedure that reported around ~70% from microwaving indole and Cu(NO*_3_*)*_2_* in acetic acid, but that just gave me brown polymer goo.

There's another that is similar in mechanism to the first one that I mentioned, with benzoyl chloride and AgNO*_3_* at room temperature for 45 minutes, but I haven't done it yet.  I'm also considering another one where the nitroso is made by indole and NaNO*_2_* in acetic acid, but I don't have access to the Indian Journal of Chemistry, so I don't know time or temperature.  I don't actually need the nitro compound (I'll be doing some further work on that nitrogen), but I could further oxidise it to the nitro if I wanted to.

More options exist, but since these reactions have been failing me so far, does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on a synthesis that I should try, or perhaps any tips on how to make this work?

"IAMA professional coffee roaster so AMA on coffee.

I've never heard of using whole beans to extract coffee, I will need to look into this phenomenon. From my view, you can use coarse ground coffee soaked in cold water for ~24 hours and get very strong extractions if using a low ratio like 1:5. That's double or triple the strength of an SCAA-standard extraction. Coffee flavor is much stronger, so you need less to put in your beer, which could explain the lack of dark coloring.

Another comment lower says to use ultra-light roast. That approach would not give a lot of positive flavor attributes -- sugar caramelizations and malliard stuff that gives coffee its unique flavor. A lot of those super light roasts are just acid bombs, very grassy, with no body or sweetness.

I've been working with a few brewers on coffee beers to make exceptional collaborations. It seems like the cold brew approach is most popular and gets best results right now. I'd be very interested to hear of different approaches however.",chemistry,16,1200.0

We used oobleck because we tried to make Silica/PEG but were unsuccessful as we could not acquire PEG. We are aware that oobleck won't be effective against ballistics but it was the only fluid we could obtain at the time.

I will take your advice and look into our sagging problem, but I wonder if kevlar soaked in silica/PEG rather than attached with a bag would be a better option.

"You have to look at the energy of the chemical bond and the recoil energy of the emission of an particle or an gamma quant.
Usally the chemical bond has an energy from 40 - 500 kJ/mol (O2N-N2O: 50 kJ/mol, Et-I: 220 kJ/mol, O2Cr-O: 480 kJ/mol).
Now have a look at the energies during alpha, beta and gamma emission: alpha: 180-1200 GJ/mol, beta: 150-1500 GJ/mol, gamma: &gt; 10 GJ/mol (note: these are all recoil energies from the radioactive decay).
So also pure gamma emitters can break the chemical bond due to the recoil of the gamma quant.
As posted before, this is called the Szilárd-Chalmers-effect and its a great tool to get high specific activites (high acitivity in a small mass/volume) and to get them carrier-free (typically you need a non radioactive carrier, because the amount of radioactive material you handle with is fbelow the pico molare range.

"You've got two problems here. First off, plated copper doesn't stick very well to polished chrome, as you discovered. Second, you are probably trying to deposit the copper too quickly.

So you should remove the chrome first. It is probably a thin layer plated onto the underlying steel, so scrubbing with some fine steel wool should do the job. Then, after a thorough washing, you should do the plating straight away, before the steel has a chance to rust.

To make a plating layer stick properly, the substrate must be completely clean, free from traces of dirt, grease or corrosion. The greasy layer formed by fingerprints can be enough to interfere, so wear rubber gloves to avoid this.

Ideally, you want to build up the layer as slowly as possible. So make the electrolyte a fairly weak solution - you don't need much copper sulfate present to make it conductive. The zippo must be the negative electrode, with a piece of pure copper as the positive electrode. Electrolysis then transfers copper from the positive to the negative, without consuming the electrolyte.

Don't go overboard with the voltage either. 6 volts is easily enough, whether you get this from a battery or from a rectified mains transformer. The rate of copper transfer between electrodes is directly dependent on the current flowing, so stick an ammeter in series with the circuit to monitor this.

For any given voltage, you can alter the rate by changing the distance between the electrodes. The greater this distance is, the higher the resistance will be and therefore the lower the current flow.

There is another problem you might run into, which is that more copper will be deposited on the side of the zippo facing towards the copper anode than will be deposited on the side facing away. Which creates an uneven layer. You obviate this by using more than one anode - one facing each side of the zippo, each one the same distance away from it. ",chemistry,3,1200.0

"I'll try explaining using fewer chemistry terms and more analogies.

I like to explain chirality in a drug-based context like a lock and key (because it's actually a very close approximation), with a lead-in involving shoes and ping pong balls (because they are easier to visualise).

If you look at a simple object like a ping pong ball (assume there are no markings on it), you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a photo of the ball, and a mirrored photo of the ball, because there are no markings that will change; there is no left side and right side, nor top and bottom, so one side can't be different from the other.  Shoes are quite different, though; if there's no writing on it, your left shoe should look like a mirror image of your right shoe.  In the same way, your right shoe won't really fit well on your left foot.  If you held that right shoe up to a mirror, you'd see a left shoe, and if you could pull that shoe from out of the mirror, it should fit on your left foot.  If you look at a single shoe, you see that one half is indeed different than the other half.  This is the important point: the existence of differences (articularly between sides), or the reduction of symmetry.

Molecules interact with your body in a similar way.

Pretend like the molecule is a key, and the receptor in your body is like the lock.  In order to unlock the psychedelic experience, you need to gain access with the correct key.  Put the correct key into the correct lock, and you are granted access.  Notice, though, how a key has different sides: the top has teeth, the bottom is flat, the right side may have a deep groove, and the left side may have a shallow groove.  A mirror image of this key will look very similar, but if the grooves are on the wrong sides, it can't fit into the lock.  You can even play around with it: if you turn the key upside down, the grooves would be on the correct sides, but now the teeth are on the wrong side.  You can't interconvert between these mirrored keys by simple rotations.

The *d* refers to a specific kind of molecule or key.  An *l* would refer to the mirror image of that (note that I could very well have said that *l* is the original and *d* is the mirror image; it doesn't matter, because it's just a matter of perspective).  If there isn't a *d* or *l* in front of the molecule, it either means that you have a mix of the two, or it's just implying a specific one.

It's somewhat important to point out:

* *d* and *l* aren't the only ways of talking about chirality; you may also see those letters in short-capital form, or (+) and (-).  They're interpreted in different ways.

* There may be additional terms necessary to specify the correct form of the molecule.

* Not every molecule is chiral, so not every drug will need this differentiation.  Ethanol (drinking alcohol) is an example of an achiral drug; you needn't specify anything else other than ""ethanol"".

* If you have a mixture of the two (which I referred to earlier), one will fit in the receptor, and the other won't.  If you have 50 locks and 50 keys, but 25 of them are a mirror image, then you can only unlock 25 locks simultaneously.  It may be in your best interest to specify the correct form so that you're not wasting 25 keys.

* The mirrored image might not be completely useless.  Carvone is an example of recognising these differences: *d*-carvone smells like caraway seeds, but it's mirror image *l*-carvone smells like spearmint.  Thalidomide is a drug that is quite famous for an important difference between enantiomers.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Everyone screws up in the lab at least once, to a greater or lesser degree. How bad it looks depends on both the context and the consequences - especially on how much money or time is lost and whether anyone is hurt or killed.

A minor mistake in a research lab which doesn't result in the loss of much time or money and doesn't hurt anyone will probably be overlooked. Although if the mistake results from a breach of safety protocol, you can probably expect disciplinary action even if the consequences are minor and harmless.

If you wreck days or weeks of work by messing up your own experiment (or worse, someone elses), costing both time and money, then you can definitely expect disciplinary action. The severity of which would depend on whether or not you breached safety protocol or hurt anyone. If it is a genuine accident, you may be able to keep your job, but if it is determined to be incompetence, then expect to be fired and not get a reference for future employment.

The situation can be very different if you work in a teaching laboratory situation, whether in a school, college or university. In that case, mistakes which would probably be overlooked in a research setting can result in more serious consequences, just because it looks a lot worse. Make a mistake which breaches safety protocol and could have hurt someone and you will probably be fired, even if nobody is actually hurt.

"Hi, Industrial Hygienist here.

First, let's clarify a few things about elemental Mercury. It is a liquid at room temperature, but only slightly toxic by ingestion. The danger with elemental mercury is inhalation. It's unlikely you picked up a significant amount of mercury on your shoes, but even a little mercury goes a long, long way in vapor concentration. Generally, a small spill in a large area will be nothing to worry about. However, if you were to have some contamination on your shoes, the effect may be magnified in a small area. Mercury contamination spreads very easily from surface to surface.

You don't mention what the floor surface was. Carpet? Hardwood? This effects how it spreads and splatters after it falls, and how deeply it contaminates surfaces.

Are there any children likely to crawl on surfaces you might walk on with your shoes, like carpet at home?

Unfortunately there is really no practical way to get rid of mercury from porous surfaces like the soles of your shoes. In reality, there will likely be a minuscule amount of mercury offgassing from your shoes, if they are contaminated, for a long time. The good news is that this risk is largely negligible.

I think your best course of action is to ensure the spill is cleaned up properly, by someone using a proper solvent and amalgam powder - not just the janitor using a mop or vacuum. For larger spills, air sampling is sometimes performed to verify things were done correctly. Your local department of health may be able to provide air sampling or require the building owner to have it performed. If they do, I recommend a spectrometer is used (a Lumex), NOT a gold-foil  concentrator (a Jerome). Spectroscopes are much more effective. If they perform this sampling, get them to use the analyzer on your shoes, too. They can do this in a headspace test, whereby they put your shoes in a garbage bag and test the air after a few minutes.

Feel free to reply with any questions you may have.

I'm fairly sure they're used all over the world. Anyway, the tubes we use fill with blood automatically when attached by the operator to a cannula using a vacuum, which is irrelevant, but why they matter is that the tube which fills with blood is actually coated on the inside with an additive.

The additives range from heparin (anti-coagulants) to coagulants (various clotting factors added) depending on how the blood sample needs to be processed, how long it should be stored, what further testing will be done with the plasma/serum etc. One of the additives - and by far, I'm not sure why, the most common - is K2EDTA (the potassium salt of EDTA). We use 4mL/6mL tubes with between 2-3mg of the K2EDTA salt.

"There are a few excellent reasons that very few people use Hg bubblers anymore. If someone opens a valve too far, you spray the hood with Hg. I did it in undergrad. Hg has a vapor pressure and you are bubbling gas through it, dispersing vapors in the hood and possibly the room if your hoods are shut off at night.  Third, someone will eventually fuck up and future occupants will find Hg in odd places such as u-bend traps in drains. You have several excellent options beyond oil bubblers, depending on the sort of pressure you need and whether you need a constant purge: a gas regulator set at a half to a few psi or a one-way valve between an oil bubbler and the manifold so you can evacuate and fill.  Both are actually superior to Hg bubblers in one respect: you (or your assistant in training, 1st year grad student, whatever) never pull liquid into your line during an evac+fill cycle.

"I think the easiest way to do this would be to have a heat cut off attached to both a thermocouple inside the oven and a detector set up outside the oven. If the set temp on the thermocouple, or above 2 ppm HF is detected outside the oven, then power to the heating elements is cut off.

To make it even safer you could use two of each so you have a back up in case of either the thermocouple or the detector fails without cutting of the heat. You could also employ a pressure sensor(s) if appropriate with the same function.

Also worth considering how you would cope with a blockage in the system. Can you vent sections to a scrubber if need be using an additional parallel tube for example?

Where is it being housed? Is the area extracted? Is a scrubbed extract required in case of containment failure? Depends on quantities really and where the extract vents to. 

What materials are you using for construction? For heating to this temp I would want at least inconel.

For something of this nature you wouldn't typically use chemistry based safety features, the system needs to be automatically failsafe. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"The two methods appear to be pretty much equivalent.  Using GaussView, you can easily define fragments within a molecule along with their charge and spin multiplicities.  Completing a guess=fragment job entails calculating the wavefunction for each fragment on their own before combining them in the checkpoint file.  

The AOMix method described in the paper you cite appears to be doing the exact same thing, but with more manual-ish steps involved.  

After running a normal G09 calculation on the open shell triplet (or whatever) with verbose output so that all important information is in the log file, you open the output in AOMix and define your fragments with the method described in their manual.  AOMix can then decompose the full wavefunction into fragments, which AOMix-FO may recombine into a new wavefunction that is used as a starting point.  In re-mixing, you use the FLIP keyword to reverse the sign of the spin for one of the open-shell fragments you defined.

I'd also like to give a plug for ORCA, which very much simplifies this process.  In the normal input, you can specify one atom whose spin you want to flip, and the package will do the heavy lifting for you as far as creating fragments and combining them into a new wavefunction.  It will even do J-value calculations for you using all three common (and constantly disputed) methods!",chemistry,3,1200.0

"Hey Material Chemist here working on new materials for computer electronics. This answer is also a guess and based off intuition alone not research so please take it with a grain of salt as it could be partly wrong I am going to take a little bit of a different take on this. I'm going to assume that you have 100% pure distilled water and ignore autoprotolysis. I am also going to assume no material degradation. But I am going to make another assumption that water gets everywhere. Transistors that make up your processor work using small nanometer sized channels that conduct or don't conduct electricity (either holes or electrons) based off a small voltage applied to the surface perpendicular to the desire current flow this is known as the gate voltage. Transistors are then linked in such a fashion that them being turned on will either turn on or turn off other transistors. Water absorbed to the surface of these materials will enevitably cause a charge capacitance to form. This extra capacitance will change the electronic properties of the transistors and all the other tiny electronic parts. This change will have little effect on there function but will affect the timing of all the parts. When these parts don't work together in the correct timing the computer will be rendered useless. So ignoring all the problems your computer might have with the chemical reactions, this will also be a huge problem.",chemistry,5,1200.0

"For chemists that advice usually means the follows: know what you doing. If you step into the lab to perform a reaction, you should first:

-Know exactly how the reaction mechanism goes
-Be critical of every single step. If you think it's not efficient enough: improve it, but let your supervisors know why you think it could be improved. 

There's a lot of small practical things as well that will usually come with experience. E.g.: How to add or weigh certain reagents, how to work under strict oxygen free environments, how to analyze your spectra efficiently, when to use which purification technique, etc etc.

A lot of the 'big questions' that non-scientists have generally lean more heavily on biology (i.e. 'How does my body work?' or 'How did life come about' - although there's definitely some chemistry here) or physics ('Why does the universe exist?') 

Seriously, I struggle to name one quality popular documentary series on chemistry, while I can name several on physics, and several more on biology.

I think also chemistry is seen as a much more 'practical' science - it's seen as less about the 'big questions' (unfairly, imo.)

&gt; Furthermore, it seems as chemophobia is also gaining momentum, which is extremely hurtful, not only for spreading false information and general fear of ""chemikuls"", but also for prospective, new chemistry students who may otherwise consider chemistry a fun, awesome field of study.

In fairness, I'd much rather deal with chemophobes then creationists ;)

&gt; chemistry topics started to shift towards other fields, at least shift towards being classified like another field

"Start with the infinite number of cute recipes for homemade shampoo on the internet whose ingredients you can probably find at a suburban high-end grocery where rich divorcees shop.

For fun, calculate the batch cost using the ""all-natural"" [coughcough] ingredients, and make a guess as to how much you should sell it for per bottle, including the price of the bottle itself. Remember, if it looks hand-made, and is expensive, it will sell.

Then hit up Amazon and Fisher to get the extras like the quats, the lauryls, the fatty alcohols, and so on - including preservatives like the thiazolinones and other inactive ingredients that make it look, smell, and feel good - that make a functional shampoo pleasant to use.

As a marketing strategy look up exotic botanical essences and other weird substances to hype the woo factor like sage oil which is full of antioxidants to protect your hair from airborne toxins (don't say which ones) or protein-rich organic bee pollen with its strengthening properties (don't specify what it strengthens), so you can make generic feel-good claims on the label. Get a good copywriter for the blurb on the back.

Then make a few variants of the same basic recipe and label them as ""strengthening"", ""clarifying"", ""deep cleansing"", ""rejuvenating"", and so on - make sure they are different colors - so that you have a whole line of products to enhance shelf-credibility.

The catch is that, just as dissolving NH4NO3 in water is endothermic, your step 3 which involves the separation of NH4NO3 from water is exothermic. Effectively this means that you are taking away heat from the freezer (cooling its contents) and releasing it into the atmosphere. In that sense, what you described is not actually a method of generating unlimited amounts of cooling power. You cannot destroy heat - you can only either convert it into work or move the heat somewhere else. So, it's not your process itself that goes against energy conservation, but rather your presentation of it that neglects this part.

Moving heat out of a box into the atmosphere is basically what fridges and freezers do, so I'm sorry but you didn't make any new breathtaking discovery. :p Also, there are much more practical ways of doing that.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"It's a very nice and ambitious thought, but you can't make drugs with kitchen chemistry.

I can make paracetamol in my undergrad labs *extremely* easily. It's such a simple molecule and it's really easy to design a synthetic route starting from readily available chemicals. Heck, the synthesis of aspirin is one of the most well-known organic labs ever - just do a Google search. It's up there with the extraction of caffeine.

Would I eat what I've made? No thanks... If you're taking drugs, you'd better make sure it's pure. I don't want to swallow some of my phenol starting material along with the paracetamol. You need proper, expensive equipment and stuff to purify and characterise the product. Not to mention the fact that suppliers don't sell chemical precursors to any tom, dick and harry that places an order online.

If you do manage to develop a cheap synthetic route, it's probably much better for a company to take it and mass produce it, do quality control, and then sell it at a cheap price. Then people can go out to the pharmacy and buy it.

Again, I'm not trying to discourage you from designing cheaper and more efficient syntheses. Medicine should be available to everybody who needs it and one way to make that happen is of course to reduce production costs. And if you do chemistry in the future, specialise in org synth, you can do this kind of stuff. I just don't think you can outsource the production of drugs to the average person.",chemistry,2,1200.0

If you look up ""sunburn"", it usually peaks every July.

This is a big problem with basis set convergence: when do you stop? Unless you're using a basis set that allows easy systematic convergence, like plane waves, you run the risk of stopping too early, either because it's plateaued early, or because of the numbers ""looking right"", in which case you're often introducing a systematic error in the basis set to cancel out other systematic errors (e.g. the functional or solvent).",chemistry,1,1200.0

"When you say analytical chemistry - what exactly was your focus?  If it is mass spec, you should be looking for QC tech type positions.  Consider looking at job postings - and if they make reference to GMP or any other regulatory requirement - try to get yourself certified, or at least familiar with the basic principles.  

Process improvement, project management, Lean, etc - familiarity with any of these is a benefit as well.  I think the ideal combination for a technologist who wants to advance is a BSc + MBA or other business course.  Most everyone can learn the scientific skills that an MSc would provide on the job - but almost all labs are severely lacking in the soft skills.

For your job experience - I would split it into two sections - ""Analytical Work Experience"" and ""Other Positions"".  This can allow you to highlight both the fact that you have some relevant skills, but also that you are employable and willing to work.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"I'll second this. You'll find quite a few parallels between chemistry and cooking/baking hobbies.

When I was brewing, I took a very scientific approach to it, writing down the type of yeast used, extraction time, overall alcohol yield, etc.

It's something I've noticed many chemists tend to do (at least in my experience). It gives you practice in following recipes/experiments and helps you build your skills of observation. Example: you're making some sweets but keep getting crystals forming before you'd like them to; how can you fix that?

"It really depends on your career goals.  If you want to be a professor with your own research group, you must get that PhD and do the postdoc.  Also, if you want to move up and be well known in a renown chemical/research company, you may want the PhD and to do an industrial postdoc.  

However, if you just want a good job with a pretty good salary, the PhD is not necessary for industry.  In fact, you are correct, the jobs that require/hire PhD level education are few and limited.  And as a PhD, it is hard to get hired for bachelor's or masters's level positions.  Good companies do not want to be known as a place that hires PhDs but only pays them master's or bachelor's wage.  It is the over qualified conundrum.

As far as experience, no matter what you do in grad school, it will not be seen as equivalent to industry experience.   

So, my suggestion is this, if really want that MBA, see if you can get it while you finish the PhD.  But if your advisor will not let you do that, and you do not want the things I talked about in the first paragraph, get the masters now and move on.  While you are finishing up, learn all the instrumentation, software, and equipment use/repair that you can.  That is the most valuable experience for getting an industry job.  Also, to have a job lined up when you graduate, you need to start applying at least 6 months before you graduate.

"This question is asked frequently.  ""Horror stories"" are all very relative and the industry is definitely competitive here in the UK.  That being said, there is something, I feel, that isn't reiterated enough:

The current job market summed up for anybody with zero experience: **Do not expect to land your dream job immediately after graduation**

After finishing my Bachelors I was unemployed for 8 months before landing my first job and 12 months after finishing my Masters.  If this is a horror story, then it's no longer a horror story because that's the reality of industry.  It's a hyper competitive market and more often than not you'll have to work a job that you have no inclination in doing long term to gain a platform for a job that you do want.

Also, there are some general trends I've noticed for people who have ""good"" jobs in a short frame of time:

* They're insanely talented.  Top 5% of their course kind of talented, laden with awards, and genuinely amazing chemists.

* They know somebody within a company.  Referrals are a common thing, but it is with all fields.

* They're in the right place at the right time.  Call this lucky.

A lot of graduates (especially at PhD level) expect the perfect job straight away.  This isn't true any more.  The cold, hard truth is that even with a PhD you might have to slog through a shitty, underpaid role to get where you need to be.  After speaking to a lot of young scientists, they all want to be somewhere else so the take-home of this is that after you finish university, don't feel like you're ""wasting time"" if you're in a role you don't like.  It's pretty normal these days.

It is in general a lot worse than it used to be, but there's also booms in biochem, materials and nanotech. It's difficult to estimate how the job market will look for anyone just starting. A couple of pointers for aspiring chemistry students: 

-You can't expect to take random courses/internships during your studies and hope for the best. Find out what kind of specialization you like and focus your studies on that. Jobs and phd positions often ask for you to have specific experience in the field. 
-Your internship work is the most important part of the studies. Set clear goals for yourself. A couple of publications are nice, but not necessary. They don't have to be published when you start doing applications. Knowing that you have publishable results from your internships is a way for your future employer to assure them you can perform quality work. (unfortunately this is also a matter of luck)
-Don't do nothing when you are applying. Finding a part time job somewhere is nice, but the best thing is to stick to something related to your studies. Think of volunteer work in labs as an investment. I know that it sounds bad having completed your studies to do work for free while there's definitely simpler jobs that are paid, but it's an easy way to improve your CV a lot.
-Mingle, socialize and get to know people in the field. Go to career fairs, lab fairs, conferences and whatever else. Talk to professors about things other than your grades. Aside from it being really good for your personal development, it also shows people you care about research. 
-Don't be afraid to share ideas with colleagues and professors. If you have a weird but plausible idea for research, just write a short proposal about it. Of course you won't get to work on it, most likely (as that is not how research goes down), but they can tell you where you could find something similar or whether or not it is a good idea and right away it gives you good practice in writing. 
-Be up to date with journals other than for courses and work (I struggle with this one myself). Knowing the other kinds of research around the world will broaden your creativity and give you new inspiration.

A traditional fluorescence software package with just emission / excitation spectra won't do the job, as the time variable isn't there.

If you're not interested in the quantitative amount of luminescence but just the rise / fall over time, you can do away with the sphere and just use a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy experiment.  Good luck! Hope you get great data.

The electron-richness of the double bond is not helpful to the stability in this case as the π orbital is orthogonal to the empty sp2 orbital and therefore cannot overlap and donate electron density into it. Conversely, in the aliphatic example, C-H σ orbitals can align with the empty sp3 orbital (already more stable due to its higher p character) via bond rotaion and loosely overlap to stabilise it (this is known as hyperconjugation).",chemistry,3,1200.0

"Ok so my background is in marine biology and marine fishes have a couple ways to desalinate. There are 2 methods that aquatic fishes can employ to desalinate. A fish is either an osmoregulator, or and osmoconformer. Osmoregulators adjust the ion concentration in their cells and tissues to maintain homeostasis, this is the most common form of desalination and it is used my almost all fish. the second type of marine creature is an osmoconformer which means that the animal keeps the ion concentration in the cells the same as the environment that the animal is in through diffusion. Jellyfish are an example of this.   

1. Marine fish are constantly drinking, active ion transport occurs at their gill arches. The Na+ ions are removed via active transport. This cuts down on the salt concentration in the blood and cells.

2. Another way to regulate osmolarity is by creating very concentrated urine in the kidneys. This is not as effective as the ion transport over the gill arches, but when you live in water that is 35 psu or higher, every little bit counts. 

As for Fresh water fish it is a little different, the issue they face is with not having enough salt. The way they combat that is pretty simple, not drinking as much water and excreting very dilute urine frequently. fresh water fish also have diffusion through the skin if they dont have scales.

Salinity is measured on a scale from typically 1-40, seawater is about 30-40, estuaries are from 5-15, and freshwater can be from 0-5 depending on how close the river is to the ocean. There are some fish that are adapted to live in both environments, bull sharks for example can store salt and travel into estuaries and up streams.  

As for employing the fish desalination in our own daily lives I don't think it would be very effective. The fish dont make freshwater, they just remove the ions down to a level where they can tolerate it. Reverse osmosis is much more efficient than fish biology, but the drawback is that the filters are very expensive.

"It is my understanding that without mixing, a wood fire pyrolizes wood to smoke which then combusts with O2. If you have visible smoke, you almost assuredly have dangerous levels if CO as well. One way to alleviate this is to catalyze fire at lower temps using cigarette ashes which are high in platinum and palladium particles. You can obtain them freely at any public ash trays. You'll notice drastic reductions of smoke and cleaner burning. Without a gauge, I can't estimate the improvement to safe levels of CO, but it can only help. Have you heard of rocket stoves?

"Synthesis is one of those things that is gated by what you've been exposed to. It's not difficult to find synthesis problems online but these problems usually don't match up to what may show up on exams. I took Ochem 1 &amp; 2 a couple semesters back and nothing sufficiently prepared us for the synthesis that would show up on exams. You just had to have an expansive and well organized ""synthetic toolbox"" to perform the synthesis in X amount of steps (almost always the fewest steps possible). With that being said, the closest thing I found to exam questions were the integrated and challenge problems found at the end of every chapter in david kleins textbook. These problems built upon concepts from previous chapters so I got a look into what a multistep synthesis drawn from multiple chapters could look like. Furthermore, it is my sincere belief that practice problems on synthesis suffer from diminishing returns. Often times students will go on doing hundreds of problems and when something shows up on an exam they havnt seen theyre lost. As such, most of the time you're better off finding an effective way to organize your synthetic tools rather than doing problems. 

E.G., in what situation should I utilize a aldol condensation vs a malonic ester synthesis? When are witting reagents applicable? When is Friedel-crafts acylation best? How about alkylation of a terminal alkyne?

Notice how all of the above examples result in addition of an alkyl chain yet they are all unique in their starting materials and the functional groups they generate. Really make an attempt to see the patterns because that's all sythesis really is.

The medium is completely clear to begin with. Well, except for the bacteria that grow in it, but those are easily removed by centrifugation or filtration.

Ion chromatography would be ideal, since the resolution and detection of sulfate using one is pretty much a solved problem.

"I think there's still a disconnect.

&gt; The challenges now are engineering programs that can take advantage of cluster computing, etc.

That's not theoretical computational chemistry, that's high-performance computing, which is more like computer engineering than anything else. Though, the development of modern HPC languages (like [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com/)) does indeed involve a pure CS effort, though the designers are more interested in practicality that purity with regard to theory (compare to something like Haskell).

&gt; The challenges now aren't ""making a geometry optimizer"" - that would be application.

That's not application, that's implementation. Application is using a pre-built program to do new science, such as [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C5CP05713B) or [this](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00898), though the second one is basically theory, because it involves *new* implementation(s).

&gt; the only papers you find that don't delve into CS are in the applied comp. chem. area (bioinformatics, for example).

Bioinformatics is not computational chemistry. In fact, aside from its direct applications to biology, modern bioinformatics relies more heavily on computer science and ""fundamental"" algorithm development than any branch of theoretical chemistry, save for things like density matrix renormalization group. To push it as step further, there is no observable chemistry period in most of what we consider bioinformatics.

I would consider theoretical computational chemistry (which is still a misleading phrase, because computational chemistry includes molecular dynamics and biophysics/soft-matter research as well), specifically electronic structure theory, to be things like [this](http://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1063/1.448223), [this](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00790), [this](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/84/7/10.1063/1.450106), or [this](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/030101049087055G), all of which require various degrees of CS knowledge.",chemistry,2,1200.0

I finished my masters and entered a Phd in analytical chemistry. I did not want to loose all the work I had put into my masters though, so I opted for a dual supervision. This means that the majority of my work is spent in analytical chemistry but I have the opportunity to implement some of that work into a classroom to run educational research. The trick to this is finding two supervisors who enjoy working with each other and can make something like that go smoothly. However, if you solely want to focus on organic, from my experience, having a masters in another chemistry field is helpful and allows you to bring new ideas to the group and your supervisor. You have to remember, you have a lot to offer and things that you are quite literate in your supervisor may not be and often they are happy to hear your input.

"Disfigurement is not really a problem. For some reason, most of the chemists, and indeed even biochemists, that I know think this is the major problem. Your bones are a calcium salt, therefore fluoride must ruin your bones. 

Your bones and your teeth are made up of mostly the same mineral, differing by concentrations of hydroxide and carbonate anions. Fluoride displaces both of these equally well. You brush your teeth with fluoride every day. Does this disfigure your teeth?

The true danger is in the nerves. Calcium is used to initiate exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, and ultimately helps regulate the size and duration of the exocytosis. In essence, the fluoride precipitates calcium, so calcium can't be used to regulate nerve signals. This causes most of the non-burn or irritant related symptoms of HF toxicity. By shutting down calcium dependent potassium ion channels, it causes hyperkalemia, which leads to a heart attack and death.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Contrary to what the anti-MSG crowd would have you believe, there is no such thing as artificial or synthetic glutamate. Whether it is free glutamic acid or MSG (the sodium salt of glutamic acid), it is all made by hydrolysis of naturally occurring proteins. Yeast extract or soy protein extract (miso) contains a mixture of protein hydrolysis products, including glutamate. But white, crystalline MSG granules are exactly the same, only purified.

Stock bases sometimes contain other flavour enhancers in addition to MSG, such as disodium guanylate or disodium inosinate. Despite their synthetic sounding names, they are actually just sodium salts of nucleoside sugar-phosphates, essentially tiny fragments of DNA. So these are not harmful either. Whether their metabolites have any effect on brain chemistry, I don't know.

You can get glutamate supplements too, sold as L-glutamine in supplement stores. So maybe you could obtain some of these in addition to some tryptophan (5-HTP) supplements. Try taking combinations of both to see if that produces the same effect as eating your turkey soup. If you cannot reproduce the effect using those specific supplements, then it must be some other component of your soup - but what else it could be, I really don't know.",chemistry,2,1200.0
"Where did you get this rock salt from? Is it a specific brand you can buy in a shop? I ask because I would be interested to try and repeat your experiment to see if I can reproduce the results. Because that is really strange, especially the glass growing white hairy deposits.

I'm also tempted to say that the salt might have fluorides in it, but since fluoride can have toxic effects above 6 parts per million, I doubt any source of rock salt containing a significant amount of fluoride could be legally sold for food use.

The only other contaminant I can think of which would interfere with glass is a strong base, such as NaOH or KOH. But again, these would not be present in salt sold for food use, since they are corrosive to humans as well as to glass.

That near-perfect separation of the base of the glass looks more like what would result from thermal shock. Such as if the glass was very cold and you had just begun pouring boiling water into it. That kind of treatment sometimes causes glass to break in a neat line.

Go to your nearest school, college or university, find the chemistry lab and ask them very nicely for some universal indicator paper or some litmus paper. If you get litmus paper, ask for some of both red and blue, so you can test for acid or alkali. Take a piece of fresh salt straight from the packet, dissolve it in water in a plastic container (so that it cannot be influenced by glass) and test it.

Red litmus should turn blue if the solution is alkaline, blue litmus should turn red if it is acidic. Universal indicator is similar - orange-red for acid, blue-purple for alkaline, green for neutral (pH 7, neither acid or alkaline). If you find that the salt doesn't contain anything alkaline or acidic, then the corrosive effect must be caused by the presence of a soluble fluoride salt, such as sodium / potassium fluoride.

You can test for soluble fluoride by adding a solution of calcium chloride (desiccant granules, for sale in DIY shops). When you mix the salt solution with the calcium chloride solution, the appearance of a solid precipitate (calcium fluoride, which is insoluble) will confirm the presence of fluoride. If you do this and find that the salt does contain fluoride, you should definitely report this to the food safety authorities.

Fluoride in quantity is horribly toxic - when absorbed into the blood through the gut, it removes soluble calcium from the blood by the same precipitation reaction. The sudden drop in calcium concentration can induce irreversible cardiac arrest. So **do not use this salt on your food** if you have the slightest suspicion that fluoride is present. However, you don't need to worry about the intentional fluoridation of your municipal water supply, since the concentration in drinking water is kept below 1 part per million, which is nowhere near enough to cause toxic effects.",chemistry,7,1200.0

"Your practical skills are the most important. If you just do whatever work has been given to you, there will be no problem. They can't make the bachelor thesis too difficult. As for organizing things, some general tips:
-Plan reactions that take a long time over the weekend/overnight. You want to minimize the amount of time you are waiting, so the more reactions are running when you are not there, the better.
-Have your procedures and tables of how much you need printed/written down beforehand. Oftentimes it's just a matter of repeating something with different amounts, so for that reason I prefer printing it and sticking it to the labjournal with some tape. You can use a calculator for practicing your skills with moles, but to be honest, you should be fluent in mole-ese after high school, so programs like perkinelmer's electronic labjournal are the best.
-Don't waste your time you could be working in the lab looking up MSDS and related literature. All of that should be done beforehand.
-Know the reaction mechanism of every step, so that you know what you are doing and can improvise in case something unexpected happens.
-Don't worry about making mistakes. Happens to all of us. Just make sure to document them, inform your supervisor and always have a reason for something going wrong (or something not checking out). 
-They'll most likely give you some related papers beforehand, but bachelor theses (in my experience) are way too short to spend a long time reading articles. You'll most likely be introduced to how things go in a real lab (as opposed to a practical course), get training on a bunch of devices and do a couple synthesis steps. Nothing fancy. Don't expect the world of it, although it's nice if you get some useful results.
-For practical things there are many dozen handy tips, but everyone does their stuff in their own way. Other students will probably tell you a bunch of things.

""XPS spectra comprise intensity versus B.E. XPS data. Since both the intensity (the area reveals the concentration) and the B.E. XPS (this reveals speciation) of the signal of interest can vary, this technique is defined as a spectroscopy. SIMS spectra comprise intensity versus secondary ion mass data. In this case, only the intensity can vary (secondary ion mass is a constant). As a result, this is defined as a spectrometry.

Indeed, ISS in this context should also be defined as ion scattering spectrometry. This definition has, however, not been strictly adhered to over the years; that is, ISS is also commonly referred to as ion scattering spectroscopy.""

If it's not shifting use acid (sulphuric, nitric, then aqua regia *in that order*) or base bath (but not on sintered or analytical glass). After these consider how much the glassware costs and if it's worth the effort.

But if you're working with mild organics, I'd say a couple washes with acetone and then methanol would do the trick. For stuff that's harder to get out, I use DCM first and then those two. For something I need really clean, I use water and soap afterwards and then some acetone again. 

It really depends on how clean you need your stuff to be. If you're running a reaction that's very sensitive to other reagents, you'll need to be especially careful and will be more likely to take care of your glassware.

If you are going for a corporate job at my level you will pretty much need a 5-6 years of experience with B.S. or 1-2 years with a PhD.

I worked for 3 years as a technician did well got promoted and eventually got enough experience to apply to the level I am at now. A few things that anyone should consider if they want a PdD (at least in the US) is:

* Can you afford it? 
* Do you plan on having a family anytime soon?
* Do you know what you want to do and is there a demand for it?

Seeing as you have little debt, are single, it really comes down to if you plan on having a family in the next several years and what you want to do? IMHO unless you have a clear plan and really know what you want to do, already have some experience in it and have established a network to land a job in the future it's not worth it. Unless you can come out not paying much or have some sort of financial support... in that case just disregard this.

"Well, you're still in undergrad so your undergraduate degree in chemistry won't really determine a career outcome. You definitely do have more doors open to you with a chemistry degree vs. psychology though. So as an undergraduate in chemistry, you're really just doing more work, more quantitative training but getting a more marketable degree out of it. 

Now, if you're talking about going to grad school after, that's a bit different. You should know why you're going to grad school if you go to grad school - like have a perfectly good idea of what you want to do with that PhD and why you want it. That's what's going to get you through grad school. The hours in grad school are long and are what you make of it - if you want to graduate early and get published, you'll spend long hours in lab. The other questions you asked depends on which labs you join. Some labs are tight-knit - especially if the PI takes on several first-year students at a time - you have friends who go through the same process as you. The pay is enough to get by but you're not making money in grad school. 

I don't have much experience with industry, so I'm sure others on here will be able to give you a good perspective on your questions if you decide to go to industry instead of grad school. 

Finally, most chemicals are bad for you and all chemicals are toxic. The only thing differentiating a poison from a cure is dose.

There are some group contribution methods that have been developed so that you can estimate the solubility parameter without having to use experimental data. Be careful in your use of group contributions coming from different databases though, as the group contributions are empirical and have been regressed from a specific set of compounds (i.e. if there are functional groups that you can't find in a particular database, don't mix and match from multiple databases). With imidazole compounds you'll have to use Hansen, not Hildebrand to get some meaningful numbers.

But don't be discouraged, this doesn't change anything. You were going to need the PI's support no matter what. But how you frame it is going to be really important. From their perspective, they're going to have to spend time and resources training you for the summer and if we're honest, there's not really much you're going to contribute to them in such a short time. So what you need to get them to understand is that A) you're bringing money to the lab B) your research will help them further their current projects C) YOU'RE BRINGING MONEY TO THE LAB. Don't be as blatant as I just was, but be sure to mention it's fully funded by Amgen and that it should cover the costs of your research. The only reason professors get involved in this type of shit is because it's a way for them to get some money. They can also pad their resume with it, but that alone wouldn't be enough, the money is the key.


You can still reach out to a grad student to chat with them, especially if you're not getting good response from the PI. But just use it as a chance to chat with them and see if they're interested in having a student for the summer and see if your research interests and personalities align.

980M destroys the GTX 680, and is about equvilant to a GTX 780. Only variance occurs at the type of effects going on and the optimization for the card. Last time I checked, a 960 is no where near a 780. The card is more in line with a slightly underclocked reference GTX 970. a 970M is closer to that of a slightly underclocked 960. Overclocking your card (which is very doable in bulky laptops like many clevos and msi laptops) typically gets them up to speed.

For Desktop GTX 980 For Notebooks, although it costs as much as a 980 Ti, it beats the regular GTX 980 by simply consuming 20 watts less (compared to reference design) and has 2x the VRAM. 

Depending on your definition of modern, I guess GTA V is decent where a modded one on High/Very High settings runs anywhere from 50-90fps variance with avg of ~78fps. Can play games like DOTA2 and Starcraft easily on 4K with decent 40fps maxed out. Having overclocked that is. I could easily get ultra 1080p if willing to sacrafice fps for slightly better than console quality (~30fps) on hard core games like crysis (which i don't own so can't test, but I have tried with games like arma 3 and gta V which do get 40fps).

According to estimates by PC part picker, similar machines to my laptop would be in the $1400 range including keyboard(dome), mouse(DS100 MSI), OS(Win8+Linux), 2133MHz 32GB ram(HyperX), etc. They all add up. When people compare laptops, they only compare the raw build, the box containing all the goodies (aka case+everything inside it). I'd save $600 if I went the PC route at the cost of portability, 4x the power usage, slightly higher temps (I have literally never went above 80 degrees with normal stock fans and pipes), and 43.75% (can't use that .5GB in 970) of the VRAM. Not so black and white especially considering it for people like me who take it on the go a lot.

Also, I was intrigued (not sure if that is the right word.. maybe saddened) by the dedication to a former student of Zakarian's who seemingly died under tragic terms. My condolences to the family of this person and the Zakarian group.

"I used to make my own Grignard reagents for organometallic purposes and never once had a problem getting them to initiate. I put this down to two main reasons:

(1). The THF I was using had been refluxed with molten potassium floating around in it for at least 3 days, then distilled from the same and stored in a large schlenk bomb with a greaseless teflon valve over molecular sieves. The sieves had been really well activated - heating inside the schlenk-bomb with a bunsen burner under high vacuum to drive every last bit of water off. So the THF was completely and totally dry. Molten potassium removes every last molecule of water and inhibitor - the sieves keep it that way.

(2). We kept a fresh batch of magnesium turnings inside a large schlenk tube under argon to ensure they stayed dry and completely stop any oxidation. Every time some were dispensed for use, those remaining would be freshly purged with more argon to keep them just as clean for the next use.

Also, I had a packet of magnesium ribbon which I kept in a similar condition. I would cut a few inches of ribbon, pull it through steel wool to make a fresh surface, then cut it into small pieces and add it to the main sample of magnesium turnings immediately before starting the Grignard initiation. This meant that there would always be a perfectly pristine bit of magnesium surface present.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Well, if you have to physically dismantle the apparatus, remove the fuse, remelt the bismuth, resolidify the bismuth and THEN reset operations, I think that is just as hard as (if not harder) than replacing a meltable fuse (especially if you *don't* have any spares!)

My primary concern with a meltable fuse is that you are going to have false positives which, as you say, will make people not take it seriously; any impurities in the bismuth (from casting, handling, exposure to the environment) are going to *lower* the melting point, and with the fuse idea the fuse will fail when it *starts* to melt. But if you have a ""molten bismuth switch"" you can ensure that a) the bismuth inside is in a controlled environment and its melting point will be repeatable and b) that even if 10% of the mass melts early (due to impurities, an oxide skin acting as a flux, etc.), only when the bulk temperature reaches 271 ºC will you trigger a shutdown.",chemistry,1,1200.0

There is another process on earth which lowers entropy - photosynthesis. This takes a gas (carbon dioxide) and a liquid (water) and converts them to an ordered solid (glucose). This is then converted to still larger molecules - cellulose, lignin, resins and everything else a plant consists of. So plant growth lowers entropy by a significant amount.

However, the earth is not an isolated system. There is an enormous external energy source which drives both global weather patterns and photosynthesis - the sun. So really, your system has to include both the earth and the sun. The heat output (and therefore entropy increase) generated by the sun is always going to enormously outweigh any local decreases in entropy on earth. So no matter what happens on earth, the entropy of the solar system and the surrounding universe is always increasing.",chemistry,91,1200.0

If you are considering using this system without Kevlar, it is useless regarding bullet penetration. If used in conjunction with Kevlar, a bullet could cause the bag to burst and the oobleck will do minimal work in terms of impact resistance and thermal dissipation. 

Oobleck is not a good system for impact resistance when it comes to ballistics. There's a reason synthetics are used for high impact resistance and polysaccharides are used as thickeners. 

Graduate school project was in nanomaterial nonwoven (sandwich) composites for assymmetric threat protection. Kevlar is difficult to top and Silica/PEG is more impact resistant than oobleck.

"Dota's basically the grand daddy of the genre.  Sorta, Starcrraft's custom map AoS is the first I think but this entire genre is based on Dota's formula.  At the moment, Dota 2 is the most hard core of the genre while Heros of the Storm is more geared towards casual players.  However, Dota 2 have tons of custom games for casual players in the arcade section.  

Dota 2 has the best monetization model in gaming right now.  You get access to every game play related feature and the only thing that you need to pay are cosmetic items, different sound track, and announcers.  You also randomly get cosmetic item after a match not that frequent but still nice.  It also got Steamwork shop and marketplace integrated so you can trade and buy cosmetics (not all though, but you can get some nice looking stuff for pennies).  There's really not reason not to at least give it a try.  It will take a lot of time if you want to not suck at it though unless you only play custom games.  

Heros of the Storm took the LoL route of monetization where you have to grind for in game currencies to unlock heroes and then grind with that hero to unlock the skill tree.  It takes a very long time to unlock a hero.  You can also pay with real money to unlock a hero but it costs a lot.  To unlock every hero with real money will cost couple hundred bucks.  There's also additional cosmetic stuff that you can buy with money.  

Smite is also popular right now and it's a 3rd person Dota and it's a pretty good spin on the Dota formula.    Good monetization model where you can buy every God (hero) in a package for $30-40 (something like that, pretty reasonable price).  or you can unlock them one by one with in game currency that you earn like the LoL model.  The premium currency unlocks cosmetics stuff only and you can get them for free by logging inevery day or during events so you can get some free cosmetics if you play long enough.

Oh for FPS, I'm assuming that you already know/played Team Fortress 2. (also get Counter Strike GO, basically a must own for any PC gamer that plays FPS).  Be on the look out for Overwatch.  It's in close Beta right now but it's pretty much the most anticipated FPS since TF2 and Half Life 2.  Paladin (by the same Company as smite)  seems to be pretty similar although I haven't tried it yet.  

Also, Tribes Ascend is alive again.  Its F2P with similar business model as Smite.   It's a team based FPS with jet pack and large open maps that focuses on going really, really fast (100km/h is considered pretty slow in that game).  Takes a lot of skill to go very fast of course.

"Usually this is formed by the reaction of calcium bicarbonate from the tap water with uric acid from the urine. This forms an insoluble salt (calcium urate) which precipitates out on the ceramic surface. When pure, this should be colourless, but it tends to trap coloured compounds from the urine - whatever it is that makes urine yellow.

This can be removed by treatment with strong acids - dilute hydrochloric or sulfuric acids work quite well for this. They will remove limescale at the same time of course. Uric acid is a weak acid, so reaction of a strong acid reprotonates urate salts, regenerating uric acid which goes back into solution. The calcium also goes back into solution as a soluble salt, such as calcium chloride if hydrochloric acid is used.",chemistry,4,1200.0
"You're getting a few answers from computational chemists, who really love their big powerful toys that don't handle medium to large molecules in a reasonable time frame.

B3LYP works really well because it takes Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham DFT (specifically B88) and mixes them together. Now, it just so happens that lots of the errors in each of these methods are opposite each other, and my mixing about 20% of HF into KS-DFT your energies are pretty fucking close to right. That's why it works, but it continues to be used because it is simple and fast. Other hybrid functionals work similarly.

Now as for 6-31G. It's what we call a valence double zeta basis, which means the valence electron orbitals are approximated by a linear combination of two functions. This better approximates the right shape of the orbital than only one function (single zeta) but forse than three, four, etc. You can add things to this like polarization (d orbitals for main group, f for transitions, etc) to better approximate things. Double zeta is usually pretty good, although ideally triple zeta with pol or better should be used if you want energies. Again, there are other double zeta bases but this is the most typically used and is defined for a lot of atoms; the others are pretty similar.

Should you believe computations done like this? Well, it depends. It's going to get geometries right the vast majority of the time. The orbitals it spits out are going to be close to what you'd get in a higher level of theory. These two things converge very quickly with basis and functional.

For other things, like energy, this level of theory will get the relative ordering of things in the ground state pretty close; it will have trouble comparing between states and it will get transition state energies rather incorrect relative to ground state. It may or may not get spectroscopy right depending on your system - things like UVVIS and IR, almost all DFT NMR is garbage.


What level of theory should you be looking for instead? Well yes, ideally MP or coupled cluster at quint zeta, but that's not reasonable past about 10-20 atoms. I'm happy with triple zeta with polarization for most things, with a dispersion-corrected range separated hybrid. This treats my molecules well, and doesn't break the bank.

Oh yeah, always do geometry optimizations at lowish level of theory first. It will get 99% of your structure and take 4 hours instead of 4 days.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Actually its pretty hard to measure deposition rates much less than 0.1nm/s even using thermostatted QCM because of frequency drift. VASE or XPS couldn't be used on-line for films thin enough to require deposition rates below this. Best bet would probably be XRR, but it'd be dicey.

The only time you'd actually do a slower deposition is for something like a telescope mirror. But that's cheating since you only deposit over a small fraction of the entire substrate at any one time and you're coating at the highest possible rate.

You could potentially measure 100A/s much more precisely.

"I was taking the appraoch of making the system able to cope with the presence of HF so it doesn't matter if it forms. This would mean you don't need to detect it inside the system, it would onlly be problematic outside. Also I'm not sure you would find a sensor that would work inside. For an external one you could just use a portable monitor ""off the shelf"".

Blockages are likely in thinner bore (&lt;1/4"") tubing if you are forming HF, so this would not be a usual event. In the event of a blockage, a wet chemical scrubber using sodium carbonate solution (with phenolthalein indicator) could be used to vent the various sections of the appartus to, via a tube running in parallel to the process line(s). You can also have a scrubber built into the F/C for secondary containment.

321 stainless is less  suitable than 316 stainless. 316 stainless is not recommended for applications involving hot HF. Monel would be the bare minimum, but the internal surface will corrode over 1/2 years and the corrosion can flake off and cause blockages. Inconel barely corrodes and the corrosioin does not ""peel off"" like with monel so is more suitable. ""Swagelok"" or a similar company may be able to help you with these parts, they are not cheap though.

Really it depends how confident you are that you *will not* form HF. If you prevent the safety features from being over-ridden and ensure that the temperature **cannot** be reached, then you can do the whole thing a lot cheaper. If this isn't the case then in my view the system should be HF compatible.

Of course this doesn't even begin to describe the necessary procedural and testing requirements!",chemistry,1,1200.0

"While what you say is true for large contact (and by large I mean &lt; 0.5% bodily surface area contact) for even the lower percentages of lab ""con"" hf bottles, I do have to say that HF can indeed cause intensely painful long-lasting burns. 

Here's how it happened... It was a newbie mistake and I was a newbie leading newbies in an overwhelmed analytical lab serving a pilot plant running on site.

The new guys are running their normal analytical routines on the AA and XRD, when all of a sudden one of the head engineers comes running in with hastily labled solid samples on filter paper and basically begs me for a rush run for all the analysis we were doing on the samples on the AA to begin with for their liquid samples, as well as a request for AA aluminum (pain, have to switch burners and run nitrous).

Anyway, of course I say ""Okay will do ASAP,  but the digestion on these solids is going to be minimum of 1 hour"" and I get to work prepping the solid samples for their 5 acid digestion right there on the spot. It was here I made my mistake, somewhere in preparing those samples one of additions of HF released a 1/100ML size drop of HF as a spray and it landed on the inside of my right thumb - it was ungloved. 

I noticed a burn right away and went to wash it off thinking not much of it. For **two years** I had an ulcerating burn wound on my thumb about half the size of a dime that was constantly painful, totally unable to heal and all around horrible.",chemistry,16,1200.0

"As a point of fact, saturated fats, as a category of food, just aren't particularly bad for you. The evidence supporting that myth has been kicked out from under it for years now, but for some reason it just won't die.

High saturated fat intake does increase HDL and LDL--a necessary response since they're responsible for carrying it--and this does thicken the blood. It's also high in caloric content, which isn't a bad property but is bad in the context of the American diet.

But it doesn't cause atherosclerosis. That would be sugar's fault--through both changes in microbiota in response to a diet high in simple sugars, and through oxidative mechanisms. Lipid peroxidation causes atherosclerotic plaques as a protective response to endothelial dysfunction--it's only very weakly related to your fat intake at all. In fact it's *empty* LDL, and LDL fragments, not carrying a lipid, that tends to contribute to plaque formation--in that sense its a disease of improper homeostasis.In fact, saturated fats are less prone to rancidification than unsaturated fats. They're also healthier in every way than monounsaturated fats--which are just terrible. They also don't fuck with the arachidonic acid inflammation pathway the way many polyunsaturated oils do, although since they increase LDL numbers they can accelerate the growth of plaques and more importantly increase the risk of cardiovascular events due to thickening the blood in disease conditions. And there's nothing wrong with animal fats. Many vegetable fats are terrible for you. In particular, the modern diet is characterized by a huge change in homeostasis between n6 and n9 dietary fat intake, and this excess in n9 fats (relative to n6) is probably a huge component in cardiovascular disease progression--that's all vegetable oil's fault.

Also oil-pulling *seems* like crazy hippy shit to me--especially if it comes with the implicit assumption that it would affect your health beyond just your mouth. That being said... it makes perfect logical sense--oil is a decent solvent, it's just like using mouthwash. Plus maybe you get some benefit from vitamin e absorption. Doesn't seem like a miracle cure to anything, but I see no reason why someone should object to it conceptually.

I get as frustrated by the ""naturalist"" mumbojumbo and arbitrarily selected new fad foods as anyone--and there's nothing magical about coconut oil and *especially* nothing magical about ""coconut oil"" products that just contain lauric acid--but it's not an *unhealthy* product.

"I actually had a very similar question a few months ago...

I emailed a couple professors at a nearby uni (mine doesn't have an engineering program) and they told me 2.5 - 3 years. If I could handle graduate level coursework, they said, as chemists we can apply for their M.Sc degree in ChemE which usually leads to a career in R&amp;D. This is a career path that is usually sought by engineering students from what I understand. They promise they won't laugh you out of the department either, it is explicitly stated on the schools website I looked at that they accept apps from chem and Biochem students.

I turned out not doing it. I applied for PhD programs in organometallic/organic chem because I realized I was just in a position where I was having a freak out over never finding a job. Keep in mind while ChemEs do have an impressive median salary range, most don't get that dream engineering job in R&amp;D like I mentioned before. A lot of engineers end up in finance or in a ""cubicle job"". Additionally, national labor statistics puts chemE at 2% job growth over the next 10 years compared to Chems 3%. Having an engineering degree isn't going to guarantee you that job. Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass there, but this is just what I have heard second hand. 

I've thought long and hard about this, OP. Before you make a decision, I recommend really asking yourself why you want to do ChemE. It's not just a significant shift in study from what you've done for many years, it's a degree that will cost more of your time and money. Perhaps watch some chemE lectures online to get a feel for what a ChemE does? There are good lectures by Stanford you can watch for free! Also, tried and true intro ChemE books are cheap if you get 1 edition older than the current. Give them a read and see what you think! I you want, I think you can click on my username and see the past thread I made about this as well (?). There's a lot of useful info in there from chemists and ChemEs alike.

Good luck! I don't mean to discourage you in any way, just try to be objective about this decision for your own sake!

"Good question. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_helium_ion_microscope) article offers some explanation, the main highlights are better resolution and depth of field. According to their [abstract](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399114000679) in Ultramicroscopy, one of the advantages is the low energy of the ions, which probably allows for better surface analysis and maybe signal/noise. As to why lithium, I'm not quite sure, perhaps it has to do with what they're aiming to study (lithium ion batteries). Wish I still had access...

Got a copy of the paper from a generous person. Basically ion microscopy offers better surface sensitivity and lower interaction volume (lower interaction = more backscatter = brighter image) than traditional SEM. Li offers even lower beam energy restrictions (down to 500eV) than previous He and Ga based ion microscopes, maximizing the advantages (surface composition/interaction volume) further. Nothing to do with lithium ion batteries as I previously guessed.

However, throw some catalysts in there and you could get all sorts of different products. You would definitely make some ammonia, probably some methane and perhaps some higher hydrocarbons. Those might then react with each other to form amines or possibly nitriles, maybe some HCN - who knows what you might get if you left it reacting for long enough.

Substitute carbon dioxide for the plain carbon, then zap the mixture with electric sparks instead of heating and you will eventually get amino acids out if you run it for long enough.

"With regards to ""trapping"" the vapours, I don't think bubbling the gas through a NaOH solution is going to cut it. 

For example, I have made propargyl chloride a couple of times from propargyl alcohol and thionyl chloride. This reaction produces vast amounts of HCl if you're not careful with the addition rate of thionyl chloride. The first time my supervisor did this reaction, he was not aware of this and despite bubbling the nitrogen outlet through ~200 ml of 10M KOH, the flow of HCl was too fast to be completely quenched by the KOH and the fumes ended up corroding a significant amount of the back of the fume hood. When I have done this reaction I can control the rate of HCl production by controlling the rate of addition but there is still a significant amount of HCl that doesn't get quenched by the KOH solution.

Therefore, my suggestion would be to have the vapours travel through three dreschel bottles: one containing KOH pellets, one containing a KOH solution and one containing just water (I'm not sure if this last one is necessary).

"Perhaps naively, I would put a HF sensor inside with the gas, and cut the temperature off as soon as possible. Is there a reason you would put it outside rather than inside? Also, do you recommend any particular sensors or cabling for detecting and routing control signals in HF?

Blockage? Such as? For the most part, it's an empty vessel with a heating element, a board, some industrial process sensors, and the Galden liquid and gas; I don't see any particular opportunity for ""blockage"". Also, not exactly sure what you mean by a ""scrubber""; is this part of a fume hood, or something else?

I'm considering construction and operating environment issues, but I'd prefer to hear recommendations, I think. I'm looking to build more from COTS parts, rather than have parts specially built. A 4 or 5 gallon drum has the right dimensions as a vessel, but I'm definitely not certain if it would be the right material in the event of HF generating temperatures. I've been considering 321 Stainless Steel, but have been having trouble finding vessels of suitable dimensions and materials; I'd like to get at least 8"" squared worth of board reflowing space.

I'll put a lot of work into making sure the control system part of this is safe, but ultimately, it has to be used by human beings. And part of *any* reflow process is tweaking the specific reflow curve for a given board's manufacturing quirks. Which opens the opportunity for some *idiot* to override something he *shouldn't*.

"Well, it's a matter of degree.  Chemistry has a strongly 'dualized' labor market.  You have different classes of workers, doing pretty much the same work, for radically different compensation.  And the conflict poisons things:  you see artificial barriers being put up.  In Econ 101, wages are set by supply and demand.  But in real life, they are 'sticky' - they don't just fall when supply exceeds demand, you end up seeing goofy stuff happen.

A heavy, non-silicone, hydrocarbon grease is probably the best idea. Acids, alkalis or hypochlorite will have very little effect on a hydrocarbon grease.

Acid might strip the thickening agent, but this would take quite some time. Greases tend to have soaps in them (such as lithium stearate) to thicken them. A strong acid would convert these back to the fatty acid and strip the counter-ion out as a salt. For example, sulfuric acid would react with lithium stearate to produce stearic acid plus lithium sulfate. This would be slow, because it could only possibly happen at the grease-water interface.

So there is a possibility that sulfuric acid in contact with a typical hydrocarbon grease might get ever so slightly contaminated with an alkali metal sulfate salt. To avoid this, you could use a pure, thick hydrocarbon such as petroleum jelly (vaseline), which doesn't contain any soap-like thickening agents.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"You don't necessarily need plant matter for pyrolysis. In fact, it tends to work a bit better with waste animal matter. I remember reading an article in Chemistry World a few years back about a pilot plant which had been developed to process turkey waste by pyrolysis.

It took in all the bits that are removed from turkeys before they are sold - head, legs, feathers, guts and so on. These were dried first to remove the excess water, then heated to destruction. They managed to produce a reasonably clean hydrocarbon mixture which could be distilled into gasoline, kerosene and diesel fractions.

There was some nitrogenous and sulfurous waste left over (from the proteins of course) and a fair bit of inorganic waste (mostly calcium phosphate) from the bones. But this is not necessarily a problem, since that can be used as fertilizer. Also, there is no reason why this couldn't take in waste from other animal sources - meatpacking plants dealing with pork, beef, chicken, lamb and so on.

There are other ways of making biofuels from animal waste - particularly the excess fat which cannot be easily sold. Meat processing industries generate a huge amount of waste animal fat, especially from beef and pork. In the not too distant past, this was rendered and used as deep frying fat - a purpose for which it worked very well, since saturated animal fats have a high thermal stability and last a long time in a fryer. But most restaurants have been switching over to vegetable oils, since these are seen as being healthier. So what to do with the animal fats? Well, they are being converted directly to biodiesel by methanol trans-esterification. This can be done with any animal fat - in Florida, where alligators are farmed for their meat and leather, biodiesel is made from surplus alligator fat.

Another common feedstock for pyrolysis plants is old car and truck tyres. The rubber these are made from contains a lot of energy locked up in the hydrocarbon polymers, so this is well worth doing. Pyrolysis of tyres can produce high grade hydrocarbon fuels - gasoline, kerosene and diesel fractions. These do need hydrodesulfurisation, since tyre rubber does contain a fair amount of sulfur from the vulcanizing process.

But as a bonus, tyre pyrolysis also produces a lot of activated carbon powder from the carbon filler used to make the rubber black in the first place. If the tyres used are from the UK or Europe, you get high grade scrap steel from the radials - but you don't get any from American tyres, since these use nylon or kevlar reinforcements instead. Just about the only other economically viable use for old tyres is to use them as fuel in cement-firing kilns - for that purpose, they can be used whole or as gravel-sized chips.

The problem with using plant matter as a pyrolysis feedstock is the excessive amount of oxygen it contains. This is because the solid matter in plants is mainly cellulose and lignin. Cellulose is of course a polymer of glucose, while lignin is a phenolic polymer. When heated to destruction, you therefore get a lot of oxygenated hydrocarbons - alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes and so on. You can tweak the process so that the oxygen ends up as water instead, but then you need to spend extra energy removing that water from the product.

Highly resinous wood is better of course, since these yield a decent amount of turpentine - a hydrocarbon which can be directly blended with gasoline or diesel for use as fuel. The resin itself can simply be distilled to produce turpentine. The residual rosins and the rest of the wood solids can be subjected to pyrolysis to make more turpentine. It is probably best to tune this process so that the residual carbon in the wood becomes charcoal. Which then has plenty of uses, such as the carbon source for blast furnaces, where it could replace coal-derived coke. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Most Chemical Engineering degrees require 2 semesters of general chemistry (more advanced than high school chemistry), 2 semesters of organic chemistry, and one semester of physical chemistry. 

Traditional Chemical engineering jobs do not utilize most of the chemistry concepts. Since you are in Saudi Arabia, I'm guessing oil is pretty big over there. With a chemical engineering degree you could work in an oil refinery, but the major is very broad and even people working in the field cannot give a clear answer. Almost all consumer products needed a chemical engineer at some point or another. 

The main difference would be that chemists are *usually* responsible for the formulation and discovery of chemicals, and Chemical Engineers take those chemicals and mass-produce them in the most economical and efficient way possible. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

The key factor that made me choose a Ph. D. was the fact that my final year project was only one year long. I really enjoyed being stuck into the project but didn't have enough time to complete every aspect of the initial proposal (this is common though) nor did I have time to apply the findings to a more practical scenario.

The Ph. D. I've got is continuing along a similar project (utilising and bringing forward novel developments to the Prins reaction for the treatment of mesothelioma). From this, I can apply my previous studies to this project. I'll also get a lot more hands-on experience leading to many more skills that I feel I wouldn't get (as much of) in industry. I'll be doing the synthetic chemistry, all of the analysis (NMR, MS, AAS) and will be taught the required biological testing. Extra to that, a part of this project will involve computational studies of the reactions I'm carrying out as such a study has yet to be performed.

"Mechanisms are memorized because if you are an synthetic chemist given a substrate and a target molecule on paper, you will need to design a synthesis which is as concise and efficient as possible. The more tools that are in the proverbial toolbox, the more likely it is that an efficient synthesis can be developed. Your friend may not have encountered many of the techniques from sophomore organic in his research, but I assure you that you won't encounter a synthetic chemist that has used none of them, and many will have used most of them at one point or another.

To answer your other question, the authors of the book begin with the most fundamental reactions — additions, eliminations, and substitutions, etc — because many mechanisms and named reactions are composed of these building blocks. The texts are designed to give a broad overview, but it is the tip of an iceberg. Any synthetic lab will use these (and more advanced reactions) as a starting point, and will optimize the conditions and reagents for their specific system. Some simple reactions, of course, are fairly plug-and-play so to speak. But this is why your experiences have revealed that it is more complicated than it is on paper. If you want to do something as simple as oxidizing an alcohol, for example, it must be optimized for the molecule you are working on. Anyone can convert isopropanol to acetone, but it may take a very long time to figure out how to selectively oxidize a specific alcohol on an oligosaccharide, for example.

It is also important to bear in mind that synthetic chemists are a broad bunch. Some are natural products chemists, often meaning that they use a huge variety of reactions in difficult, lengthy schemes. Overall yields are low, but there may be dozens and dozens of steps to construct a complex skeleton. Major synthetic papers are published detailing the synthesis of one very complicated molecule, and maybe a few variants. Other synthetic chemists will use a small, versatile toolbox to synthesize a broad class of molecules in order to explore useful properties, often of an electronic or photochemical nature. There are more than this.

Either way, the benefit of having a broad variety of reactions at your disposal is invaluable if you are involved in synthetic chemistry. It helps you understand how synthetic pathways are developed, and if you are in an organic position, it is your bread and butter. Since you are an analytical chemist, it may not be of value to you.

If you are only concerned about adsorbed hydrocarbons, another method such as UV/Ozone will suffice. I usually use ~30min.  Keep in mind that contamination adsorption starts instantly and spontaneously upon exposure to ambient air, although the rate of adsorption depends substrate and air composition.

If you are looking to clean other substrates besides glass, thermal annealing can also be used.

"I had the fortune of getting to the job-searching point right at the apex of the great recession. I made it a goal to send out 10 apps per day, and I must have ended up sending out over 300. I had interviews and call backs, but never landed anything. In the end, what got me a good job was a recruiting agency (Point One Recruiting), and it was a very nice experience. The recruiter mediated between me and the employer, did all of the salary negotiations, and I ended up with a salary higher than I would have settled for at that point.

I didn't think to look at recruiting agency sites until near the end of my searching, they list out the positions they're head-hunting for. Even if you do not see anything appealing on their list, DO contact them and speak to a recruiter over the phone. They'll ask you questions about your likes, dislikes, what kind of work environment you prefer, etc., because it's in their interest to help land you a job. If/when a company opens a position through them and it's a decent fit for you, the recruiter will call you and pitch it to you.

One thing to note when 'just wear gloves and you'll be fine'ing is that nitrile is not a good glove choice for this.  Fluorinated rubber is your best choice, [this is the style that I prefer.](http://www.coleparmer.com/Product/Best_Viton_Gloves_large_12_mil_thickness_1_pair/WU-86288-22)  They're a little expensive, but they'll last a while.  They're a pretty good catch all for most things that nitrile isn't sufficient for, especially chlorinated solvents like DCM, so you'll get a lot of use out of them.  Even butyl rubber has a breakthrough time of around 30min, which isn't great for extended use.  

The toxicity doesn't seem that bad really, LD50 in rats through dermal contact is 650mg/kg, so you'd need to practically bathe in it to kill you -- but that doesn't really say anything about how much will make you violently ill.  Sigma doesn't list any acceptable exposure levels which typically means you don't want to be exposed to any.  A fume hood is obviously a must.  Don't open this outside of a functioning (not over crowded) hood.  

Toxicity aside, it also has a reasonably high vapor pressure at RT and is a sensitizer.  Even if you're not exposed to large amounts, and you suffer no problems, you could develop severe allergic reactions to it in the future.

The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this.

The second half-reaction features hydrogen peroxide behaving as a reducing agent, giving off electrons to some other species:  this reaction produces protons, which is favored under basic conditions (think of the base consuming the protons, this pulls the equilibrium to the right by Le Chatelier's principal).

Depends where you are, who you're working for and what kind of role it is.  Bigger companies pay bigger salaries however are hell to work for.  Smaller companies pay smaller salaries however you don't want to kill yourself.  My friend works for Astra Zeneca after finishing a grad scheme with them and says the best thing about the job is the money.  I work for a small company and am hanging out on Reddit.  You can't have both.

&gt; What are the best ways to find science jobs (any city is fine)? 

Google.  Put ""chemistry jobs [area]"" into your search and have a look through, find a job that sounds good.  Repeat search replacing chemistry jobs with the title from your previous search and you're away.  Also, if you know of a company you'd like to work for, search for them directly.  Sometimes they go through an agency leading to an online ad, and sometimes they don't.

&gt; Additionally, what could I do with this degree &amp; experience that's not chemistry related?

A bunch of things.  With a chemistry degree you have problem solving, numeracy, literacy, compiling reports and thinking in three dimensions covered.  Ultimately though, if you don't know what to do I'd ask yourself what job you would do if you could do anything.  A dream job.  Work backwards from there and see if your degree fits.

Good luck!

"1) Learn to survive in a lab without butting heads with people and without injuring yourself or others.

2) Learn the techniques you'll need for the rest of your grad career, and get skilled at them (purification, air-free handling, interpreting spectra).

3) Show an intense curiosity in your work; constantly be reading related papers in any down time that exists.

4) Pick one or two tasks that the group in general has to do (refill solvents, keep up with order receipts, do safety inspections, inventory, be 'that guy' for cyclic voltammetry, etc) and volunteer to do it for the group.  Don't let it impinge on your research time, but contribute something valuable to the team that makes everyone's life easier.  

5) Show an intense - no, darn near heroic - effort to make progress on your research.  Document everything - photos of reactions in progress, clear and concise notebook entries, spectra of everything.  In my experience nothing frustrates a PI more than him/her asking ""What did you find out?"" and being told ""The reaction didn't work..."".  What do you mean it didn't work? Did you get back all starting materials with nothing changed?  Did it turn jet black and all decompose?  Did you make some side product?  Show me pictures or drawings of TLC aliquots, show me 1H NMRs from the crude mixture, show me spectra of all your column fractions.  Have an answer for why a reaction didn't work, and search the literature (SciFinder helps here) to find alternate routes which might work.

6) Make friends.  The head of the NMR department is your buddy.  So is the MS team, so are any post-docs in the group that you can get knowledge from.  Don't be known as the guy who never talks to anyone and never cultivates relationships or shows up to departmental seminars.

7) Chase down anomalies.  Get a weird result from a reaction?  Have a more experienced group member check your setup and read your notes (bribe them with pizza).  Still getting a weird result?  Analyze the heck out of it.  I did this at the end of my first year with a tiny peak in a mass spectrum that I didn't understand, and it led to 2 years worth of thesis work, a brand new catalyst system, and multiple papers.

If you could care to elucidate?  My conclusion is that either this is not the only (or necessarily main) mechanism of aspirin's NSAID activity, or salicylic acid somehow gets acetylated at some point in its metabolism (in the liver?).

Consumers influence by dollar voting of course but these type of changes only matter to a few people. 90% of the general public buy OEM stuff and barely know what's inside the case. 

The top post clarified when it changed:
&gt;The 340.52 driver is responsible, and was released July 2014.

And another poster clarified that solutions were found but also ""fixed"" to keep people out, not just casual users
&gt;At some point it was working, then another driver update disabled it, then people found a way around it, then Nvidia decided to become more sneaky, then people fixed that, then Nvidia decided to introduce even more checks inside the driver. Most people kinda stopped caring much since GPU-PhysX wasn't really appealing anyway.

In the OP's case, he is NOT even using the AMD card for anything. It is merely in the PCIE slot sitting there. He is still using Nvidia GPU's but the Nvidia GPU detects the AMD driver and shuts down the chance for PhysX. 


It's nearly the same situation with passing through a GPU in virtualized environments (vGPU). AMD allows it for any card. Nvidia disables this for their GTX lines and you have to do a work around for ESXi to use it. Quadros will passthrough just fine.  It just done for the sake of increasing profit margins.

"Well, chemistry isn't a popular science anymore. The reason for this is,  imo, a lot of chemistry topics started to shift towards other fields, at least shift towards being classified like another field. For instance, everything biochemical is now under the name of biology (structural biology vs. bioinorganic chemistry). Chemistry took a pretty big blow with the emergence of Materials Science as a new field, and everyone started talking about materials chemistry as a subfield of materials science. Even drug design would be classified solely as pharmacology, and not organic chemistry. It's like chemistry is taking the role of biology as being the most uninteresting science, while biology is dominating right now, especially with the development of biotechnology and genomics. 

Furthermore, it seems as chemophobia is also gaining momentum, which is extremely hurtful, not only for spreading false information and general fear of ""chemikuls"", but also for prospective, new chemistry students who may otherwise consider chemistry a fun, awesome field of study. 

My last point would be, chemistry as a science doesn't have as awesome marketing as biology or physics has. Just think about all the movies or series made in last few years which promoted physics (perhaps indirectly) and were very successful, for that matter, I can think of Interstellar, The Martian, and of course Cosmos. Biology is fascinating because when someone sees a picture of a DNA molecule they are already in awe, just think what happens when you start talking about cancer, neurodiseases, diabetes, biosynthesis, etc.

"It ultimately depends on what sort of chemistry you will be doing and therefore what sort of Crude Reagents and Products (CRaP) you will have to clean off the glassware. This is broadly speaking the answer to your first two questions - yes, there are standard methods, but there are also methods appropriate to what you are doing, which is why some chemists swear by one method and other chemists insist on a different one.

If most of what you do is organic chemistry, then the majority of your glassware can be cleaned by a rinse with acetone or methanol, which tend to dissolve away most crude organic crud. Sometimes you have to use a more powerful solvent, but most of the time, the cheap bulk solvents are the answer.

If you are doing inorganic or organometallic, that's when glassware cleaning can get serious. Solvents alone are not usually sufficient to shift inorganic clag, which is why people resort to base baths, acid baths or more vicious methods such as piranha solution. 

Cleaning fritted glass can be a real pain, because you can't just stick that in a base bath unless you want to drastically change the porosity by dissolving glass from the frit. That's when piranha or chromic acid comes in handy, though the latter is frowned upon these days because of the toxicity and carcinogenic nature of hexavalent chromium. One method I was taught for cleaning fritted funnels was to fill the funnel with a mixture of solid potassium persulfate plus concentrated sulfuric acid, then blast it with a hot air gun. This creates concentrated persulfuric acid, which oxidizes more or less anything.

People who work with smelly stuff like thiols, organic sulfides or phosphines often swear by bleach baths to decontaminate their glassware. Which, to be fair, is pretty much essential to avoid going home every day smelling like a sewer. Though god help you if you end up working with thioacetone - there isn't anything on earth which gets rid of that smell!",chemistry,2,1200.0

Instead, I might focus on making your show a tribute.  Pick some of his favorite or most well known demos and put your own spin on them.  Instead of the traditional version of ""Dr. X's Demo of Awesomeness"", create your own patter.  Whatever his traditional lines are, turn them around to make them about him or somehow in his honor.  If I were him, I would just be thrilled that my students had gone to all the effort of getting good at the presentation and had come up with a creative show.  Trust me, it doesn't have to be something he has never seen before for him to be touched.  Focus more on the quality and scripting of the presentation.  Add in some lines about whatever he is known for (e.g. that tie he wears on exam day, his bad jokes, or whatever his thing is), and he will remember it for a long time.

"You're right in your comment to the other reply.  Learn functional groups and basic interconversions in case the customer asks these things (i.e. know the difference between an oxidation and a reduction).  You won't need the mechanisms although knowing what something can possibly be converted into is very handy.

Other basic stuff to know is how difficult certain things are to make not in terms of mechanisms, but in terms of availability of reagents and how dangerous they are, for example, coveted structures in pharma tend to employ a lot of fluoro compounds which can be very dangerous to make, so telling your customer to make more fluorinated compounds is something to avoid.

As somebody who works for a chemical supplier, the more chemistry you know the better.  Reading around the subject in your spare time when you get a chance can only help, it'll also help you win business - my biggest pet peeve is being directed to somebody who knows zero chemistry.

Now, of course as a lowly undergrad I'd be doing repetitive, rote work, but in general I observed that the graduate students chose from a collection of a few reactions for their work. 

Granted, though, the PI's main focus was on *physical* organic chemistry, so synthesis was only a means to an end. I can see actual *synthetic* organic chemists drawing from a much wider range of reactions, so that would make memorization much more useful.

&gt; Why is potassium written outside the square brackets?

The ferrocyanide ion, Fe(CN)6^4- , is a multi-atom ion, like sulfate is, that takes 4 potassium ions to form the neutral salt. Similarly the ferricyanide ion is Fe(CN)6^3-

&gt; why is CN written in parenthesis?

That is the cyanide ligand.  Yes, cyanide.  But it is much less dangerous complexed up in ferrocyanide and ferricyanide than it would be in, say, potassium cyanide, KCN.

Modern nomenclature has ferricyanide as hexacyanoferrate (III) and freeocyanide as hexacyanoferrate (II) because the iron is in oxidation states III and II respectively.

"Oh sorry, that was worded weirdly. I don't think the WHO was saying that antimony hasn't been used in solder, but rather that there is no evidence of ill effects. 

The one thing to remember is that historical uses would have been pure antimony, right? Which is going to be wildly different from the 5% found in solder. Not just because of it being only 1/20 as much, but because antimony corrosion is inhibited by the passivation of tin in the solder. And even a sloppy solder doesn't give a ton of surface area. When I was working at a city water bureau, our lab was running tests of contamination due to fixtures, and I was surprised at how minimal it was, even in the setups with brass fixtures that we knew had lead. 

Also, it's not like antimony tablets would have been standardized in any way. I was just reading a thread in /r/AskHistorians about how hard it is to assess the effects of widely available medical heroin, cocaine, morphine, etc., because it was totally unregulated. So it's difficult to quantify what was going on back in the day, you know?  

Finally, if you just google ""antimony solder drinking water"" you can find all the original studies of how much antimony goes into drinking water from solder. For example, [this one] (http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000TRZ7.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C81thru85%5CTxt%5C00000007%5C2000TRZ7.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL), which found ""minimal"" increases in antimony exposure after switching to Sn/Sb solder. Specifically, levels were always below the 1.4 ug/L detection limit. [This book](https://books.google.com/books?id=AeVGoP8jMmIC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=antimony+solder+drinking+water&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lceAhibJP3&amp;sig=QRuHmPTA9-vtpgxtHwWdsQA1dg4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwiPCO5I7KAhXHQyYKHQFuCFIQ6AEIbzAR#v=onepage&amp;q=antimony%20solder%20drinking%20water&amp;f=false) cites a few more studies. 

I still think it's an interesting hypothesis for this case (some sort of crazily bad soldering, plus some interaction that leads to excess antimony leaching or something?), but I don't want people reading this to get freaked out that they're exposed to antimony, since from everything I read, it seems super unlikely.

"If  you spend your time in sophomore organic memorizing reactions conditions you didnt do it right. The ""pedagogical reason"" for mechanisms is to teach students how reaction proceed and how various functional groups interact. The point was building up a ""chemical intuition"" that you can apply toward any system, any molecule, any substrate. 

In a practical sense, understanding these mechanisms and why a reaction proceeds as it does is fundamentally important for reaction optimization. Those ""arbitrary steps"" you mention are often done to drive the desired mechanism forward and prevent side reactions (the mechanisms of which you should also know) that will kill your yield. 

Everything you learned has a practical application in organic synthesis, and every step of a reaction is there for a very specific, mechanistic, reason.

"I'm in my final semester of my bachelor's program, and I have a few paths that I would be interested in pursuing.  Maybe some readers here have insight into some of the fields listed below and  would kindly offer some input into which I should decide.  

The first interest is research in computational chemistry.  I've had a growing talent and interest in programming since high school, and I believe I might have a competitive edge if I write my own theoretical software.  Experts report that quantum computing will become commercially available within the next 5 - 10 years.  These new computers are expected to excel at performing calculations relevant to molecule simulations(Force - Field, DFT, et. al.) and high - resolution quantum approximations (Hartree - Fock).  It would be my absolute pleasure to be first to deliver the next generation of computational chemistry software to these new machines.    This path is my most ambitious, but it seems to also be the riskiest.  

Another field of research that I've developed significant interest for is catalysis, specifically focused on organic molecules.  The reason why I might choose this path is peculiar topic of study called the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM).  OCM is the catalytic coupling of methane (sometimes also CO2) to produce ethane: one of the most prevalent industrial organic feedstocks.  OCM was popular research for many decades up until the '90s in the energy and petrochemical industries.  The idea then was: ""We use coal and petroleum for fuel, but they are also our primary organic feedstock.  Wouldn't it be economically brilliant to make a  renewable, cheap, and abundant fuel like methane into an organic feedstock?""  Interest in OCM has evaporated since about 1995, but it seems to me that not all avenues in chemistry have been explored, considering that many new tools and methods have developed in the last 20+ years.  This one may seem discouraging because the reasons for abandoning OCM then still hold true today, but I revisit the topic for new reasons:

* Finding greater industrial use for methane increases its economic value.  Which provides incentive to collect and market methane by whoever it's produced.  For those concerned about global warning: Methane is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas, and right now it's mostly allowed to be released into the atmosphere.

* Space travel in the coming decades and centuries will take humanity to destinations beyond our imagination...and likely easy, reasonable preparation.  One factor that easily gets overlooked is energy consumption.  While I have no qualifications to assist current and future astronauts, it is my belief that remaining energy/feedstock resources like coal and petroleum should be reserved for future space travelers and colonists.


Sadly though, I'm not an A average student, which brings me to my third option: Skip grad school altogether and take my chances with just my bachelor's degree.  I understand that most chemistry positions require a Ph.D., but I may not make the cut.  It's not too late to start a distillery, right?

EDIT: One more is Nuclear Chemistry.  I've been interested in nuclear energy since a young age, and I believe it doesn't deserve the bad reputation that it's acquired over the last few decades.  However,  the nuclear power industry in the United States has suffered many cases of downscaling and closures, so opportunities for new graduates seem to be nonexistent.  Regardless, I remain hopeful.

"I was fired from a tech company for trying to offer fair services.

I was sent to investigate a phone system that kept failing on the customer. My boss had, without my knowledge, quoted them for a $27,000 replacement system with every bell and whistle imaginable. I walked into the room and noticed it was about 105 deg F and the phone system almost burned me when I touched the outside plastic.  I left the door open, put a fan in the doorway and their issues disappeared. There was ducting for ventilation in the room so I quoted them for a much cheaper ventilation system, a cleaning of the hardware and mounting a fan to the passive heat sinks.

"That is how I would do i as well. If you are really concerned about precision, there does exist a difference between different pipettes. Naturally the 1-20 uL pipette will be more precise for those concentrations than a 1-100 uL. It´s always better to pipette once with a bigger pipette than twice with a smaller one though. 

What can make a difference is whether or not your compound is completely dissolved or otherwise properly homogenized. Your concentrations will of course be off if it isn´t, but it might not always be obvious to the naked eye. Sticking to the same temperature for all samples might be a little thing you can try. 

Also, I would take an NMR of the thioflavin. It might be that it´s either not completely pure or that different parts of the container are less or more pure. Who knows who else used it or how much it has decomposed? (Although I have to admit I personally never used it before)

"Okay, so I'm going to give you a brief photochem primer. 

Imagine a fire: any flammable material that burns below the fire's temperature will eventually burn. Similarly, any reaction or process that requires light can occur so long as the light is of a higher energy than the process. The rate it occurs will depend on the chemical's absorbance of the specific wavelength and quantum yield for the given process. The quantum yield for a process is the odds of that process occuring divided by the sum of the odds for anything occuring. It is between 0 and 1.

So now that we have established this, what can we do that's fun? (profitable is a lot more work and it's 9am on Sunday). I'd start with some cycloadditions and see what isomers form. See if you can induce stereospecificity and regiospecificity.

"Oftentimes the fun/hobby chemistry you can do at home is just colour changes and making crystals out of common compounds; basically stuff for an ""ooooooo, ahhhhhh"" effect from an uninformed audience for whom it's all just a magic show. If you really want to do something fun (and often stressful... it's a love/hate relationship) get into chemistry research when you're in university. I don't know exactly how it works in the UK, but in general, after your first year of undergraduate studies, you can get into a research lab where you can do *new* chemistry by trying to solve a problem or make something new, instead of just repeating colour changes in your kitchen that were discovered 100 years ago. While not impossible, getting into research after first year is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure if you're keen, try hard, and with a bit of luck, you'll get a chance to do some undergraduate research during university. Again, not sure about the UK, but in my country (Canada) you can usually get a summer job doing research in a professor's lab. You might be the dish washing bitch for a postdoc or PhD student, or you might actually get some serious responsibilities, but regardless, you'll get the opportunity to discover new chemistry. Until then, anything you can do at home is basically just a magic show. Not trying to discourage you at all, just saying that research is where the real fun lies.

"Nybo has some great advice. I took a bit of a different approach. I didn't do this for every reaction, but for the ones I deemed worthy I'd list the net rxn, the mechanism, its limitations, functional groups before and after, intermolecular variations, and my comments on when I thought such a reaction should be used. I fit this all on one page and by the end of Ochem 2 I had ~45 of these pages. I found this more useful than making lists because when referring back to a list with 40 such reactions I tended to overlook things during an exam. By making each reaction its own entity and focusing in on its unique properties things were more difficult to miss. Again, everyone learns differently but this was most effective for me.

"I personally HATE the sodium and water demo.  I prefer controlled reactions, I think there's more 'art' to them.

We do sometimes heat (NH*_4_*)*_2_*Cr*_2_*O*_7_* to decompose it - yielding N*_2_* gas, water vapor, and Cr*_2_*O*_3_*.  Some predecessor of mine bought a large supply of the stuff back in the Old Days, back when life was cheap.  

Sadly the stuff is scary.  All Cr(VI) compounds are scary.  Not only can they cause various health problems, but they are suspected of being carcinogens.  And not only that, but the whole Erin Brockovich thing, some company dumping lots of it in people's water, has given it a really awful reputation.  And it's therefore mega-illegal to dump even a few micrograms of it down the drain.  Because it's easy to detect, and has a rotten reputation, because some jerks dumped tons of it in an aquifer once.

When you decompose ammonium chromate, the reaction does not go COMPLETELY.  There is always some residual starting material.  Sure the product looks like pretty, harmless green Cr*_2_*O*_3_*, but if you were fool enough to touch it, it would leave orange Cr(VI) stains on your hands.  Maybe raise some blisters if you were chronically exposed.

So doing this demo - you have to do it in a closed flask, run the exhaust gases (and there are a lot) through some glass wool or filter papers to catch any flying debris.  When you're done, you need to rinse out the entire apparatus and the Cr*_2_*O*_3_* product first with water and then with sodium bisulfite solution, extensively in both cases.  The bisulf**ite** (cannot use bisulf**ate**, which will do nothing) will reduce the deadly and illegal Cr(VI) to safer, blue-colored Cr(III) species.  Now you have a whole lot of blue waste, which you can basify to precipitate - this can take a few days.  

The Cr*_2_*O*_3_* makes a really great green paint pigment.  And while I've never actually tried it, I want to test it as an ammonia oxidation catalyst someday.

"You've got to count charges here. You need 2 chromate ions to form a dichromate ion. Each has a 2- charge (total of 4-), and the resulting dichromate has a total 2- charge (i.e. oxidized). The redox couple in this situation is water/hydronium (from 2 H3O^+ to 2 H2O, i.e. reduction). This is why dichromate is favored in acidic conditions.

edit: Based on your argument about Cr not changing it's oxidation state, the electron sharing in this case is a bit more complicated than conventional ionic bond type charge sharing. The Cr atom doesn't actually have a fixed 6+ charge on it.

Edit2: u/oldlabrat is right. Sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. There are atoms that get rearranged, but not electrons. This is just an acid-base reaction. It's actually two acid-base reactions in series with chromate and dichromate in equilibrium with HCrO4^-",chemistry,0,1200.0

To add a bit to the background, the method is a quick 6 min gradient that monitors about 100 different eicosanoids (fatty acids) isolated from plasma. The old method was running at 500uL/min so I dropped the flow rate down to about 150uL/min with the drop from 2.1 to 1mm ID. I agree that maybe some ion suppression is taking place but 10% increase in signal is consistent across the 100 compounds which span the entire gradient. I would expect suppression to be localized to certain retention times so I am leaning away from that. Theoretically the change from 2.1 to 1mm should increase concentration on column 4x which is consistent with my experience but this is just odd.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Yeah man, the 5450 was a significant upgrade from intel ""hd"" 3000, i bought one for my brothers computer, he wanted to play warframe and such, it didnt work out well for him but he didnt mind the sub 20fps at his monitors resolution (1600x900), i kept telling him he could get much higher than 20fps if he turned down the res to 720p as it has ran a ton of games decently at 720.

I like your story, i can relate to it a lot, though im only 21, and had recently just got a job last year and had put together enough money to buy myself some parts, though i did buy my parts in a weird order, and spread out through 4 months, I bought the GTX 970, and Pentium G3258 in july this year and since i had no other computer to put them in, they sat in my bedroom right behind the laptop i had at the time (HP ProBook 6560b, i5-2520m, 8gb ram upgraded, radeon 6470m) so for 3 months i would sit there playing my games at sub 30, while being slapped in the face by my boxes hahah. 

After those 3 long excruciating months, i had the money to buy a psu, case, motherboard, ram, and a cheapo acer 1080p monitor, and put it together. Ran everything perfect for what i wanted to play like gta5. It only ran at 30fps, it would go higher but it would stutter, but a few days after i put it together i won $250 from a scratch off, put it towards my i7 4790k, and bam, my computer is finished. Just black friday i picked up a logitech G230 for my brother, a G600 mouse and a logitech G930 for myself.

Well i cant exactly say finished.... ;).

"Organic/Polymer/Analytical (no idea about physical/radiochemistry).

If you're looking for highest impact, you might want to look at which area produces the most products. My guess (without looking at any numbers) would be that Organic or Polymer chemistry are the top users of solvents, while inorganic chemistry (batteries, materials, catalyst, or inorganic solar cell production) are the top users of heavy metals, rare earths, or other ""high demand elements"" (lithium, indium, etc). All these can be improved by:

- Using LESS solvent: flow reactors, or non-petroleum-based solvents, such as water or supercritical fluids.
- Recovering solvents: recover solvents after a process and demonstrate they are as clean/pure as when they went in, is of great interest. 
- New catalyts: swap heavy-metal catalysts for iron/sodium/organic based-catalysts.

Analytical chemistry uses a lot of solvent or compressed gases for HPLC or GC. Two big issues in Analytical chemistry, especially for pharma, is switching GC methods from using helium to hydrogen and making hydrogen in-house with generators. The other involves converting solvent-heavy HPLC methods to UPLC/UHPLC methods which use orders of magnitude less solvent (super-critical carbon dioxide can be used in the case of SFC - which is nearly carbon neutral because the ""mobile phase"" is extracted from the atmosphere).

"Well professors are really busy and especially if you go to a research university they tend to orientate their priorities again. It took me maybe a week of trying to personally talk to the professor and show him that I legitimately wanted research experience, even then he took some time to respond. My advice is wait for a week tops and maybe 2-3 days minimum. Rather than emailing I would suggest setting up an appointment or going to their office hours even if they do not teach you. Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule. You just got to wait it out. If you can read their research, and note everything you dont understand  so you can ask them. 

This is from my universities website concerning undergrad research
""Either write a compelling, concise email or stop by the faculty member's office. if you write an email, do not write a generic email saying, “Hi!  My name is ____ and I’m interested in doing research with you. When can I start?” You’ll almost never get a response. You must put some time into this if you are serious about doing research. You can think of this process as being very similar to finding a job — it's a good idea to have a resume ready in case you are asked for it and you must always be on your best behavior (make sure you don't have spelling errors in your emails, etc.)

Hints for writing a good email:

Introduce yourself: ""Hi, My name is _________.""
State your purpose: ""I am planning to go to grad school in chemistry and am looking to gain some research experience in a lab before I apply."" OR ""I’m thinking about becoming a chemistry major and would really like to get involved with research in the department.""
Give some background: ""I’m a sophomore chemistry major with an overall GPA of 3.4, and a chemistry GPA of 3.8. I have taken 103/104 and am currently enrolled in 311 and 343.""
Talk about your interests: ""I’ve always been interested in polymers and would really like to understand their environmental impact.""
List a specific project: ""I saw on your website that you were conducting research with biodegradable co-polymers and would love to learn more about this project.""
Ask if they are taking students: ""Thus, I was wondering if you are taking any undergraduate researchers this semester.""
Ask to set-up an appointment: ""If so, may I set-up an appointment to further discuss your research and this opportunity?""
Make sure to say thank you: ""Thanks for your time. I look forward to hearing back from you.""

"Most reasonable profs won't really expect anything. If you're working on a project with established chemistry (repeating a previous student's conditions exactly, making literature compounds, etc), then you should be making compounds in reasonable (though not necessarily outstanding) yields and be able to purify them. If you are working on really new chemistry, you probably won't produce much of anything, but you should be refining your skills, getting comfortable in the lab, learning new techniques, and you should be able to speak intelligently about what's going on (""reaction didn't work"" = starting material? decomposition? rearrangement? deprotections?).  
Don't feel too bad. Most people get shit all in their first 6 months. Use this time to soak up knowledge from older students/postdocs - even people outside your group (if they're friendly and willing). Pester them about your chemistry. Ask them questions about theirs.

"That's an intriguing idea, but [this WHO document](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/0304_74/en/index8.html) refers to a no-observed-adverse-effects level of 6.0 mg/kg of body weight per day. I have trouble imagining OP ingesting that dose, especially given the following excerpt from the WHO report:

&gt;Antimony at one time was considered as a possible replacement for lead in solders, but there is no evidence of any significant contribution to drinking-water concentrations from this source. The concentrations in drinking-water appear to be less than 5 µg/litre (US EPA, 1984; Longtin, 1985).
 
So even if OP were only 50 kg and were drinking a liter at a time, the water would still have to have antimony levels 60,000 times as high as the EPA found to have an effect. I just don't see 300 mg of antimony dissolving from solder into one drink of water. 

Also, the WHO says that

&gt;At one time, antimony was suggested as a possible replacement for lead in solders, but there is no evidence that this has occurred. 

It's definitely worth ruling out, especially since antimony isn't in the standard water tests, but it doesn't seem super likely to me. I'm not an expert, though! And thank you for sharing all the historical information about antimony, that was really interesting to read. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Soaps and other detergents work by having a hydrophilic (water-miscible) section at one end of the molecule and a lipophilic (oil / fat soluble) section at the other end. When dissolved in water, these form clusters, with the lipophilic ends all pointing inwards, forming a sphere with the hydrophilic ends on the surface. This is called a micelle, and looks like [this](http://www.ekshiksha.org.in/images_carbon_its_compund_X/figure_12.JPG).

Soap dissolves oil in a similar way. The lipophilic parts of the soap molecules bind to the oil, absorbing it into the centre of the soap micelle. These enlarged micelles are still soluble in water, so get flushed down the drain when you rinse the soap off.

The temperature has two significant effects on this. One is that hot water dissolves soap more rapidly and results in a more concentrated solution. The second effect is that the hotter the soap solution, the faster the water and micelles are bouncing around. So in any given time frame, there are more collisions between the surface and the soap, and these collisions have more energy as a result of the higher temperature.",chemistry,3,1200.0

My first approach would now be to find out how exactly the machine works. I suspect that it takes in a constant *volume* per time, so the answer you get will actually be in w/v. But maybe the software already accounts for that and you can set it up to give you whatever you want (in terms of unit). Then it's for you to decide what is required. One way or the other, you need to understand what the software does.

If you provide the name and model of the ICP somebody might know...

Once you understand where that number comes from, you will then be able to interpret it correctly. All the answers are already in your own original post. All you say about specific gravity and ppm and so on is spot-on.

My impression (that might well be wrong) is that perhaps you have been doing things not entirely correct, but because you work in aqueous phase that has never been an issue.

Even if it feels like being back in school: Work out the maths, including the units. It will tell you what's going on.

"I work as a supervisor in a large energy company and agree with a number of things already said here. To add/emphasize some things:

-Use PDFs not word files. PDFs are easier to read on a phone/tablet. Reviewing CVs in an airport/plane is already annoying so make it easier on the reviewer. It's usually easier/faster to open for printing purposes. PDFs also retain formatting whereas word files can open strangely and mess up formatting so you lose some control over your personal marketing.

-Personal connections are important but don't force it. There are hundreds of applicants per job postings that all have PhDs from good universities, solid publication records, and claim to be great ""leaders and team players.""  If you know a recruiter from on-campus meetings or conferences then that can help differentiate yourself BUT just because you LinkedIN the person doesn't make you best friends. Networking is more that social media stalking. Build the relationship over time. If recruiters come to your university then get to know them early (if possible). I recruit at my grad and undergrad alma matters and welcome meeting with students at all levels. It allows me to see their progression through the program and evaluate their personality/communication skills much better. At the other extreme are the candidates that show up when they are defending in 2-3 months with no post-grad plan. They typically put on a full-court press and email blast + social media assault me for a few weeks then disappear when a 1 year post-doc pops up then repeat the process in 10 months when their contract is not renewed.

-Don’t oversell your results or blast competing research groups if you do get a phone call or on-site interview. Badmouthing other research is never a solid strategy. We hire from all over the world so there might be a person from that group in the room. That also applies to overselling work. We add a few people to an interview schedule with intimate knowledge of the field that have read the candidates papers. If you oversell your results it tells us a lot about you. It typically means you would need more oversight if you were hired because making a business decision on an oversold idea is…bad for business. 

-If you are presenting at an on-site interview, tell a coherent story highlighting your specific contributions to a research program. We are not hiring your PI because he/she already has a job. Interviewers need to know what you are bringing to the company. That also means to avoid a data blitz presentation where you try and talk about literally every project you did. Try and pick a primary project that highlights how you identified a problem, came up with a plan, executed that plan, and what was that result. As a side-note, bring your presentation on a few different formats. IT problems happen so be prepared.

-Dress appropriately for the company you are interviewing with. If it’s a hip start-up then recognize that you have some freedom with your style. If it’s a large energy company it may (likely is) more conservative so don’t push it. Distractions, especially those that mask your real skills as a scientist, hurt your chances especially if you are on the bubble versus another candidate. Black, grey, blues, and whites as far as clothes. Get a haircut and shave. Be put together. As an aside, if you have dinner during a site-visit and alcohol is available, remember the interview never stops when you are there. Be appropriate and “on” the entire time. 

-Be prepared to answer questions in a polite and calm manner. Don’t get defensive and it’s okay to not know the answer off the top of your head. You should be able to think on your feet and hypothesis on the fly. Simple answers like, “that’s and interesting question that I don’t know the answer off the top of my head but, I would think (insert hypothesis/speculation here). If you get a suggestion that’s off base or somewhat stupid, don’t use the interview as a way to correct the interviewer. “That’s an interesting idea that we’ll have to look into” is a polite way to defer and move on. The person on the other side of the table already has a job, you don’t.

"&gt;Of course, HCl and NaOH, for instance, only have pHs of 0 and 14, respectively, at certain concentrations. Is there some ""standard"" concentration used within chemistry that's being assumed? 

Yes, it's for a 1 molar solution. pH is the negative log of the molarity of hydrogen ions in solution, so -log(1)= 0 (as HCl has a 1:1 ratio of moles H^+ to moles HCl). 

Now, NaOH works differently. When it dissolves, it dissociates into Na^+ and OH^(-), rather than H^+ and some anion. To calculate the pH of this, we need to use another measurement - pOH, which, similar to pH, equals the negative log of the molarity of hydroxide anions in solution. pH + pOH = 14, so if we rearrange that, we get pH = 14 - pOH. 

If we have a 1 molar solution of NaOH, that gives us 1 mole of OH^- for every mole of NaOH, and then pH=14-(-log(1)), which simplifies to pH = 14-0 = 14. ",chemistry,5,1200.0

"**Both** Valence Bond Theory and MO Theory are approximations of the truth, and how close you get with either approach depends on how far you take them. One is not intrinsically more complete than the other. There are systems that are easier to describe with MO Theory (such as using Huckel MO Theory for aromaticity), but VB Theory will give you an equivalent answer if you do it properly. The equivalence of these approaches have been known since the 1930s, yet most chemistry texts will teach that MO theory is superior to VB theory. It isn't true.

To learn more everyone should check out the publications by Sason Shaik and Philippe Hiberty (such as this excellent [Account of Chemical Research](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar030162a)), which are nicely summarized in their recent [monograph](http://www.amazon.com/Chemists-Guide-Valence-Bond-Theory/dp/0470037350/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453399165&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=Sason+Shaik).

I don't mean to go off on you and I agree with what you are saying, but the whole ""VBT isn't as good as MOT"" is a huge misconception that more chemists need to be aware of.

Edit: /u/MJ81 beat me to the punch and referenced the relevant chapter of the book I mentioned. Still, the paper I linked is a really enjoyable read. It's a transcript of a fun conversation between Roald Hoffman and Shaik and Hiberty about the history of the VBT-MOT rivalry.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"I’ll tell you how: I don’t.

I’m trying to plan something up but I can’t, because I don’t know the diferences between the several fields of chemistry in the work world. And that’s what I am trying to find out. I’m just a careful person that doesn’t want to work hard for something with zero opportunities. But there’s nothing good about chemistry in my country and I can’t find good information anywhere. I just know that I want to work on Physical Chemistry/Theoretical Chemistry/Computational Chemistry because those are the fields I love the most (and I think I might like working on materials development, drug design, or other specific research. Definitely not Organic Chemistry). But I want some assurance that I will have a job and a salary that allows me to live without stressing out about money, that’s all. Believe me, I’ve searched for information, I’ve talked with experts, teachers from my country, teachers from outside my country, and I can’t find anything useful. I want to know what/where is the best field I can study to work on what I like and be rewarded by it.

I was in high school and I loved Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. I wanted to study something that joined them, so that I would have more options when in need to choose one specific field/career. So I went to the best engineering school in my country because
1. it’s is the only good Chemistry related BSc in my country
2. People (my teachers) often said that Engineering connects Maths and Physics (and they were right), so Chemical Engineering would be fine for me
I happily applied for Chemical Engineering, “taking it as it goes”, but throughout the course I realized that I don’t want to be a Chemical Engineer… at all. I started to question my future, thinking about what I loved the most about science, because for me that’s the most important thing: work on something I love. And the answer is: quantum chemistry, atomic structure, chemical bonding, thermodynamics, spectroscopy. I also like programming as well. What I’m trying to say is: I didn’t plan it out young, it just happened that I chose a degree that I don’t like as much as I thought, thus I was “forced” to choose that “planned out stuff” in order to don’t waste this BSc. Consequently, the idea of taking a master related with Chemistry (and not Engineering) grew in my, and I decided that I wanted to focus my MSc on that, so that I can have more job opportunities on the area.

"The voltage generated by an electrochemical reaction is directly dependent on the reactivity of the element or molecule in question. The reaction you quoted above is one of the half-cell reactions in a zinc-air cell - it is what happens at the zinc electrode. Strictly speaking, this generates a positive voltage, so should be written as - 1.28 V.

The reaction at the other electrode is the reduction of oxygen:

**0.5** O*_2_* + H*_2_*O + **2** e^- -----&gt; **2** OH^-

That reaction generates + 0.35 volts. So the full cell creates 1.63 volts overall. The net equation is just the oxidation of zinc by atmospheric oxygen to form zinc oxide. The water present is not consumed, since one half cell creates water at the same rate as the other half cell consumes it. The same is true for the concentration of OH^- ions.

Other metals can be used instead of zinc, which will generate different voltages. For example, aluminium is more electropositive (more reactive) than zinc, having an electrode potential of -2.3 V. So an equivalent aluminium-air cell will produce 2.65 volts overall. Magnesium is even more reactive, with an electrode potential of -2.7 V. So a magnesium-air cell would produce 3.05 volts.",chemistry,4,1200.0

Overclocked Pentium is not enough for the GTX 960.

The stutter makes a bunch of games annoying to play, and in games where mouse movements matter a lot it sucks playing with a pentium. Plus, overclocked Pentium still can't touch an i3. And considering the costs for a proper cooler and the G3258, you can pay a few bucks extra and just get an i3.

"Hiya!  Thanks for the giveaway.

I bought a PC in 2004 which had decent specs at the time, but didn't replace it until 2013.  I upgraded a few things in it, and it was basically running an 8400 GS 512 mb card, which is ridiculously bad, but it ran Half-Life 2 okay haha.  

Anyway, I finally decided to save up and get a new pre-build, due to fear of building my own.  So I found a sale going on newegg and they insanely marked down a prebuilt PC twice due to two interfering sales between president's day and valentines day.  So it knocked the price of the PC from $889 to $360.  The build was 8320 FX 3.5 GHz, GTX 650, 8gb DDR3 and 1 tb HDD.  The mobo isn't the greatest and the PSU was shit, but it played last gen games perfectly well and the price was so cheap so I didn't pass up on newegg's mistake.  Then earlier this year I upgraded the PSU (to a CX600, but lesson learned, I'll do better next time) and then the graphics card to a GTX 970.  Temps were high so I decided to get a hyper 212 evo next.

After installing the cooler, and having to deal with taking out my mobo and putting it all together again, I basically felt like I had ascended because my fear of PC building just disappeared.  Now I'm desperate to save up for the future and my next PC is going to be built entirely by me.",pcmasterrace,1,1200.0

I do know the following - 

VDW corrections improve structural predictions for organic molecules for all typical functionals (except LDA). You can have an empiric correction (Grimme D) or a more 'ab initio' like correction (TS). In many cases, either TS and D are better as corrections than using functionals which are empirically tuned to be ""good"". 

For activation energies, especially when you have pi electrons, you might have configurations that require that  ""extra correlation"" to become stable. Those could be the geometries that you need. Thus you stand a chance to get qualitatively wrong results in terms of structure, which will lead you to the wrong thermochemistry.

"Titration won't help determine pH, unless you already know the composition of the solution. It will help you determine acidity or alkalinity, which are not the same as pH. 

There are solid state sensors that can determine pH. But they depend on a layer of a compound with functional groups of known pKa in order to work, which is the same as using indicators.

"So I don't know anything about the industry of magnesium sourcing, but I am going to guess it wouldn't be worth the cost for manufacturing these materials and you should just sell the MgCl2. You might find out if you could contract out the work I suppose, and see if that makes any more money.

So going from MgCl2 to Mg would require reduction, and the easiest way to do that is almost certainly electrochemical reduction. You basically pass electricity through it and pops out shiny magnesium metal. The biggest problem (that I can foresee, and I'm not an expert at electrochemistry or manufacturing-scale chemistry) is that you'll produce chlorine gas as the byproduct. This might be used for something else, but because chlorine gas is reactive and dangerous it will make the process more difficult and expensive.

And then going from Mg to MgO is just burning it, which won't be too hard because Mg is quite reactive. 

And this is just the start of the questions you'd have to ask.

"If you do a year in industry (sandwich degree) you won't have any problems finding a job. I think everyone from my cohort either had a job or PhD lined up before graduating, minus a couple that decided to wait until after graduating to apply. Also, you can try and get a placement abroad if you want to test the waters somewhere. Takes a bit more searching though :)


The employment prospects depend a little bit about what area of chemistry you're interested in as there are more jobs in some areas than others. Problem is you don't know what that is yet and it's largely impossible to guess. I went into my degree with a very clear target and quite frankly would almost rather stab myself in the eyes than do that now. Basically, if you're thinking synthetic organic/pharma side then a fair few of those ""horror stories"" probably apply but a lot of other areas are fine. If you actually make some effort to make yourself employable instead of doing nothing for 3-4 years it'll work out for you. 


Nobody is in this industry for the money, really. As a guide a placement year will bring you anywhere 13.5-19k on average. After you graduate 20-24k is again average for a typical entry role, plenty of shit QA things knocking around at 18-20k if you don't have any experience though. Graduate schemes more like 25-28k but that's a different working experience so consider the role. Your salary should climb quite quickly early on, and then you'll hit a plateau around 35-40k (~5-7 years perhaps, depends on you/your company).

While research is not absolutely necessary for a degree, I believe it's a HUGE component of degrees in science. You learn so many skills that you won't get in the classroom. For graduate school, undergraduate research is essentially a prerequisite. 9 times out of 10, you'll be working with a graduate student or a post-doc in a Professor's lab. So you won't start with your own project. If you do good work, you may be given an independent project, though.

Dust as nucleation points for crystallization is one thing (one of my old supervisors used to scrape his beard onto the flask for this), but it could always be that your catalyst or other reagent is not at all what is making the reaction work.

One of my ex-colleagues used an iron catalyst for a certain step and performed this reaction many times. When he had to order a new bottle of catalyst (the old one was from the 60s/70s probably) the reaction suddenly stopped working. Turned out the catalyst itself used to contain small amounts (0.5%) of cobalt impurities. The company making them improved their techniques and now all of the cobalt was removed. So instead of the iron (which was already in there in a catalytic amount) the cobalt made the reaction work with a spectacular turnover rate.

"You could always put a disc of filter paper on top of the glass frit. Yes, this does make it more like a buchner funnel filtration, but since a frit has far more pores (and much smaller gaps between each pore) than a buchner funnel, it will still be more effective.

This will slow down the filtration somewhat, so applying vacuum to beneath the frit will speed it up a bit. Or if you use a short column container with the screw-neck fitting at the top, you could apply some pressure to the top at the same time, just as you would when running a column.

Another option would be to blow the trapped powder out of the frit afterwards. Attach a nitrogen line, then loosely wrap a plastic bag around the mouth of the frit. Blasting some nitrogen through should loosen the powder, which will collect in the bag. If the pressure from a nitrogen cylinder isn't enough, then you could try a compressed air line, but be careful with that - too much pressure could fracture the frit.",chemistry,6,1200.0
"Okay, let's do the first case first - if you have all para substituents but the substituents are different for some reason. Then the molecule is no longer symmetric and you would expect to observe four different signals in the aromatic region. If, on the other hand, you have all para substituents but the substituents are the same, then the molecule is symmetric and you would expect only two signals in the aromatic region with twice integration. 

Now, what if you have some ortho/meta product? Well, if you have the same substituents on the phenyls and only one of them is in an ortho/meta position, then you should observe six different signals in the aromatic region. If both of the substituents are in the ortho/meta position, you will observe a different number of signals, depending on whether the molecule is symmetric or not. 

A COSY will help if you have a hypothesis about the structure and can identify at least one characteristic proton. A COSY spectrum is only with protons and will just tell you which protons are coupled with which other protons. It doesn't really give you information about the carbons. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"What do you mean by getting into it? Understanding the theory or finding a job within the field?

If you mean the former, then I'd say it isn't very difficult for the most part. You don't need to memorize reaction mechanisms, but it gets pretty complex (pun intended) once you get to something like the Nernst-Planck-Poisson model, which can be used to describe the diffusion of ions in the membranes of ion-selective electrodes.

If you meant the latter, then I don't think I can give a really helpful answer. I started working towards entering the field early on in my studies so I probably don't have the experience that would be necessary to give advice that would be applicable to your situation. Is doing an internship a viable option for you? I started working towards entering the field around the start of my third year of studies and ended up writing my bachelor's thesis at the laboratory of analytical chemistry. Doing an internship at the laboratory definitely gave me a foot in the door (research experience, contacts, and the chance to write a master's thesis later this year).

Regarding book recommendations: which field of analytical chemistry are you interested in? Electrochemistry, flow injection analysis, spectrophotometry, chromatography, or something else? I'm focusing on ion-selective electrodes at the moment so I would have a difficult time recommending books related to other fields, but I might be able to get some recommendations from the staff at the laboratory. ""Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications"" by Allen J. Bard and Larry R. Falkner is regarded as a good book, if you want to learn about electrochemistry.

A lot of the materials we used in introductory courses were written by the staff specifically for those courses in order to avoid the need for (expensive) books so I'm not sure what would be a good book for general analytical chemistry. UC Davis has a wiki about [analytical chemistry](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Analytical_Chemistry) and several other fields. It looks like a good place to get an introduction to analytical chemistry without immediately paying a bunch for books.

Also, you should use ""-"" as a separator between chem.shifts for multiplets. if you want to group signals use comma.

What this means is that if the driver is aware that when a CUDA program finishes and needs to pass data to a DX/OGL program on the GPU, it can just pass that reference instead of copying out of the GPU and then back in which is incredibly slow due to latency.

This is why black box models are good, they give flexibility to implementors to do weird things like that as long as final result is the same.

On CPU's when you copy or move data from one register to another nothing actually happens to the data. The CPU merely renames the register to the one you're writing to or make that register point back until the value's actually start to diverge.

"Hi,

I am currently a grad student in comp/theory.

A background in programming is not necessary, but you may find yourself wanting to get familiar with programming for data analysis. You should feel comfortable in the terminal to begin something like this (but I've seen people with almost no computer skills learn to run MD simulations within a few weeks of struggle).

The points I give below apply to most questions of this sort.

A good starting place is considering *what do I want to simulate?*
Consider the underlying physics. If you can write the formulas of what you want to observe with statistical mechanics consider molecular dynamics or monte carlo. If you require quantum mechanics use post Hartree-Fock or DFT.

Do you want to simply look at a change in structure? MD will work. Do you want to look at the process of polymerization? That requires bond formation which requires quantum mechanics. A note: SCF is not orthogonal to MD; there exists QM/MD origrams such as terachem but its sounds fairly impractical to apply to a polymer.

Lets say you wanted to observe the unfolding of a polymer w.r.t. temperature. This could be observed with molecular dynamics. Now you need to consider what program to use. I don't know your system but NAMD is a good starting place because it is fairly user friendly. If you'd like some reading suggestions I'd suggest skimming [Jensen's comp chem](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computational-Chemistry-Frank-Jensen/dp/0470011874) Let me know if you have more questions

"Screwing up routine experiments is more common than you think - it's human nature to be more careful when doing something the first time, less careful the thousandth time. It's hard to say what a ""normal"" rate is, but more than once every two weeks (on important experiments) would be cause for concern. Tolerance for mistakes tends to be inversely proportional to the expense and importance of the experiment in question.  
The more important part is figuring out what went wrong. Don't just do it the same way and ""hope"" - be analytical about it. First off - how do you know you screwed up? If you're basing it only on the results of the experiment, are those results consistent with a user error (e.g. well-to-well variation of replicates, negative control is higher than positive control) or are they a systematic error? If it's a random error, check your notes from days when things went well (you do take notes, right?) - what's different? Did you stick to incubation periods more rigorously? Did you pre-chill a reagent, or let it thaw for longer? Vortex vs. mixing by pipetting (it can make a difference!)? Try to replicate your ""best"" conditions. And be extra paranoid about doing each step - make a checklist and keep it next to you at the bench.  
If problems persists, or crop up randomly:    
* Check your reagents. Everything within date, stored properly, right pH, right concentration, etc? Check it experimentally! pH meter, Bradford assay, gel check, etc.  
* Check your instruments. Is everything calibrated? Are you using them the right way/same way? Again, check experimentally (run a 96-well plate of blanks; pipette a coloured solution and measure absorbance, etc)  
* If you're getting systematic errors, either you're omitting a step (be more paranoid!) or there's a problem with your technique. Double-check against an SOP.  
Supervisors appreciate people who generate results, but an intern who can recognize bad results, troubleshoot, and find sources of error will get a pretty good reference letter, too.",chemistry,3,1200.0

"Those subreddits get a lot of their content from things that come up in pop science. As a result, things that sound exciting and romantic on the surface draw people's attention, so these are the things that people ask about and up vote. It's quite superficial that way.

When it comes to chemistry, a lot of the more interesting stuff requires you to scratch below the surface a little. Which often involves studying it a bit. If you have a casual interest that's not something you're going to be hugely interested in - you're going to want concepts and trivia. This is why people flock to the buzzword ""quantum"" but lose interest when it is extended to chemical bonding. For example, two of the ten most cited papers of all time outline Density Functional Theory, but as a topic it requires you to be more invested. So you'll see people talk about Shrödinger quite a lot, but not Becke or Pople.

Because a lot of the interesting parts of chemistry require some background knowledge, and they tend not to be single concepts that can be condensed into trivia, they're inaccessible to a lot of people. If you take someone like Einstein, people can visualise his work a little better - thinking about things moving isn't particularly foreign, so the basis is there. Or someone like Schrödinger, who has an easy-to-outline thought experent associated with him, that will draw people in. Then take someone like Woodward.

"Well if water is insulating, and air is more insulating, and ions make water less insulating, there's no amount of ions that would make water as insulating as air. You'd need a negative or complex number of ions. 

You need to figure out what value of conductivity you consider the minimum for something to be an conductor. Pure distilled water does, in fact, conduct electricity--it just does so so poorly that we consider it an insulator. Adding more ions makes it conduct better.

The only question is this: what is the threshold between conductor and insulator? That's largely a matter of opinion, not fact. If you were designing something you would use the actual conductivity values, not just the label.",chemistry,3,1200.0

"Would test first, if formamide is really uv active, because it doesn't really look like it just judging the structure (altough this can be misleading). If formamide indeed is not UV active: try TLC stains, but I think amides are pretty hard to detect with most standard stains. If you still can't see the formamide with the stains that you got around I would try running your column on pure luck, get those UV active spots and pray to god it's indeed your product and that it wasn't running together with side products that were not stained.    
If you can't get a pure product with the ""pray to god"" approach it's time to find some stain that will allow you to detect your side products, there are plenty of sites who give some infos about this: http://chem.chem.rochester.edu/~nvd/pages/magic_formulas.php?page=tlc_stains (generally great website about lab-know how).    

Also you seem all over the place with your solvent systems. In my experience you're fine in the vast majority of cases with cyclohexane/EtOAc and MeOH/DCM mixtures.

Yeah, however much unemployment benefits your country provides. There is absolutely no market for theoretical chemists.

So as the steel wool is dissolved, the carbon is left behind. You can't really avoid this by using iron wool instead, because most iron contains more carbon than steel.

If you have a supply of sulfuric acid on hand, then you can regenerate the copper sulfate from the copper metal produced. Not directly of course, because copper metal doesn't dissolve in sulfuric acid unless it is concentrated and heated.

But once the steel wool has completely reacted away and you have a solution of iron sulfate with powdery copper metal, you can isolate the copper by filtration and washing with water. Then, spread the wet copper powder on a baking tray and cook it in the oven on maximum heat. Or aim a bunsen burner or blowtorch at it. Then it will become copper oxide, which you can dissolve in dilute sulfuric acid to regenerate copper sulfate.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Hey there, so I think I may have a bit of advice that could help since I recently went through a similar process.

I'm in my first year of grad school working on a PhD in biochem, I went straight from undergrad where I did organic synthesis research.  I have always been involved with teaching/mentoring and knew that I really want to teach at a smaller school some day.  A school where I won't have 300 students in one lecture. 

Well, I applied to about 10 grad schools in which 3 (?) of them were for a PhD in chemical education and the other 7 were for chemistry.  I also applied to a few masters thinking only about chemed.

I ended up going to a top research school for biochem, because they also have certificate program in graduate teaching.  I will be working on this certificate throughout my PhD and found a PI that supports my interest in both wetlab and educational research.

The reason why I chose the more traditional PhD was because after talking to many people who do ChemEd research, is that spending 5-ish years doing research will allow you to relate more to your future coworkers who only do or are heavier in research.  One advisor especially said compared to her friend who did a ChemEd PhD (my advisor did a PhD in inoragnic chem), she felt like she could still navigate the chemistry world better, even though she no longer does traditional chemical research.

If you could find a school supports both of your interests, I would suggest that, because in all honesty, it will give you more options career wise if your first choice in career doesn't workout.  

That being said, if you still want to go full ChemEd, I say go for it.  STEM education has been neglected in traditional educational research, and we need some badass pioneers.  The ACS has some really great resources for ChemEd too if you poke around.",chemistry,6,1200.0

"Ok, another idea for you: try running the water for 5 minutes and then sample it to see if it causes any upset. This would flush out the standing water which could be picking up the contaminant (say from the pipes) over time. If you don't get any symptoms this way, then it could be that something is gradually leaching into the water from the pipework.

Then again, if your water is giving you those kinds of symptoms that quickly, maybe you shouldn't be sampling it directly anymore. If you do, take in only a small amount and only take more if you feel fine.

You already said the water next door was fine. How many of your neighbors did you check with? I would try to ask a few more of your neighbors in all directions from your house if they have any issues with drinking their tap water. This would at least make it certain that the issue is coming from your house alone.

"Cold brew uses coarsely ground coffee, not whole beans, and usually has a higher caffeine content than normal coffee.  

In homebrewing of beer, there are a few different methods for making coffee flavored beer.  

The first is adding grounds at flame out or the very end of the hop boil.  Since the wort is at boiling (or hopefully just below boiling in the 195-205°F range for brewing coffee) adding the grounds at the end allows for some sort of control over extraction time (which should be a couple of minutes, depending on the grind) before filtering out the grounds and cooling the wort.

The second involves cold brewing.  It's dry beaning coarse grounds (or I guess whole beans, but I've never read about someone trying to brew coffee with whole beans) in a secondary fermenter (container used after primary fermentation is finished).  This is the equivalent of cold brewing a homebrew sized batch of coffee using beer instead of water.

"Not necessarily true. An increase of entropy elsewhere is required in order for a local increase of entropy, but the latter doesn't always cause the former. Consider the following examples:

(1). A refrigerator causes a local decrease in entropy inside it. This requires the movement of heat against the normal gradient - cold to hot, rather than hot to cold. The processes which accomplish this can't ever be 100% efficient, so the mechanism of the fridge always generates more heat outside it than is actually removed from inside it. This is an example where the local decrease in entropy (inside the fridge) does cause an increase in entropy elsewhere (outside the fridge, usually behind it).

(2). The earth itself at the onset of an ice age. The precise weather conditions which cause an ice age are complex. But one commonly accepted theory is that an ice age can be triggered by an unusually large increase in snowfall in areas where the melting of snow is typically slow. This is because snow and ice reflect the majority of sunlight which falls on them. This causes a drop in temperature, which causes even more snowfall. Due to the drop in temperature, the snow melts even slower and reflects even more sunlight. This self-reinforcing cycle continues until the majority of the landmass of the earth is covered in snow and ice.

In this example, the sun and the earth are considered together as a system. Does the earth getting colder actually cause the sun to emit more heat? No. The amount of solar energy produced by the sun doesn't change. The amount reaching the earth doesn't change. The only difference is that less energy is absorbed by the earth. So in this case, although the entropy of the earth decreases and the entropy of the solar system (and the universe) increases, the former doesn't cause the latter.",chemistry,2,1200.0

At least that's how it is in the US. I would contact the colleges you're thinking about and ask them this question.

2. ChemE is a very versatile degree to have with many applications and room for flexibility. /u/chemjobber would have more insight, but if I didn't suck so much at math (turns out it was just a bad teacher), I would of absolutely gotten a ChemE degree instead. It's safe to say that ChemE kids have a place in most chemical, biologic, and mechanical/physical fields. During your program, find research to do. Apply to external and internal research opportunities. Look for short interning jobs - make sure it's paid. Find what you're passionate in, these majors have something for everyone.

"I'm not sure if I agree with your conclusion here.  I've worked under / alongside numerous PIs and all of them have been outstanding chemists.  They've all been trained, to a very high degree.  The problem as I saw it (as part of the faculty at a top 10 US school for chemistry) was the administration.

The administrative burden on academic PIs is ridiculous.  Teaching classes, designing courses, overseeing research of sometimes 20+ group members, being on committees, traveling to conferences, departmental activities, writing grants, writing papers, reviewing papers for journals when asked, etc.  

Most academic PIs simply don't have the time to train a new grad student in lab methodology.  It's not that they couldn't; it's that they can't fit it into their schedule.  Part of the shock you get going to grad school is that you think you're going to work under some great professor, only to find that your training comes from postdocs and older graduate students.  Ultimately, you end up teaching yourself.

When I was a PI in industry (R+D lab for scaleup), it was a completely different story.  A few meetings here and there, but for the most part I was in the lab, the majority of the time actually.  So I don't know if it's necessarily a malicious act on the part of academic PIs, but I do agree that their students would benefit enormously from their presence in the lab, teaching them technique.  Of course their students also benefit from being funded, so there's that

"Thanks for the google search, but I was hoping to find imidazole itself or preferentially some sort of database with more moieties. Something like Scifinder, which doesn't seem to have this. I'm making an imidazole derivative, and while the derivative is indeed very soluble in EtOAc, the starting imidazole (used in excess) appears insoluble. Some resulting imidazole-HCl is also observed as precipitate. Filtering off this gives me my desired product without any imidazole observed in the liquor, but I want to be able to quantify that if possible. As a comparison study, I also did the reaction in acetonitrile but had to do a basic wash to remove the residual imidazole (it's very water soluble). That's why I'm hoping a database would have the solubilities of both.


The first example you link to is an extraction of an imidazole derivative between H2O and EtOAc; while that works fine for many derivatives that have an affinity for the EtOAc, imidazole itself tends to go the opposite way. Washing an organic mixture with water is a great way to remove imidazole (it is extremely soluble in H2O), which is why I was indicating it's relatively insoluble in EtOAc.


But yes, you're correct that many imidazole derivatives would certainly be soluble in EtoAc.

"There are some which illustrate the trends inherent in the layout of the periodic table. The most visually impressive are those which involve the alkali metals or the halogens.

We all know about the classic alkali metal demonstration - throwing pieces of lithium, sodium, potassium and so on into water to show the increase in rate of reaction as you go down the group.

But the halogen one is less commonly done, mainly because of the difficulty of performing it safely in a school or college lab. I am referring here to the reaction between halogens and hydrogen. Start with iodine, which is rather reluctant to react with hydrogen at all, since HI tends to revert back to its elements when heated.

Then HBr, which needs a temperature of around 300 ^o C to make from hydrogen and bromine. HCl is easier - a bright flash of white light (such as that produced by burning magnesium) is enough to ignite a mixture of hydrogen and chlorine. Finally, mixing hydrogen and fluorine, which is spontaneous, violent and unstoppable, resulting in hot HF.

You can also do a simple demonstration of the differences in physical properties of the noble gases. Just filling some balloons with each one is an obvious demonstration of the differences in density. Helium and neon obviously float, while argon, krypton and xenon sink - more rapidly as you go down the group. Also, breathing in the heavy noble gas xenon has the opposite effect on the voice to that of helium.",chemistry,9,1200.0

"A borosilicate (pyrex) glass container is perfectly fine to use directly on top of a hotplate. Pyrex can take the heat just fine, up to about 400 ^o C, or more if it doesn't have to withstand pressure or vacuum.

Provided you don't subject it to extreme thermal stress, it is unlikely to crack. So heat up the sand-bath and the hotplate together - don't wait until the hotplate is hot and then put the sand-bath on it. Let them cool down together too - don't take a hot pyrex vessel off the hotplate and put it down on a cold surface.

Whether you can use your clay pot instead depends entirely on the distance between the top of the hotplate-stirrer and the bottom of the flask. If it isn't much more than it would be using the pyrex container, it will probably be fine. You're right that some clays do contain magnetite, but the concentration would have to be rather high to interfere with a magnetic stirrer.

"&gt;﻿However, more to your point. I think that given the three options you provided I would lean towards choosing #1.

The most typical way that I figure this out in others is to ask them how they feel about traveling and experiencing other cultures. If they think this is an important part of their identity, that they have to have a variety, that no culture is better than the other, then they are usually in camp #1.

&gt;﻿That having been said, do not think that my views fit into these categories. 

These are broad stroke, core theories. In the same sense, you won't learn everything about a dog by knowing cellular biology, but you will know that the ""dog"" emerges from it.

Plus, sometimes you just hold conflicting views, and this is a result of the cultural competition that I spoke of either. Memes are duplicated when there's a cultural victory, kind of like genes during sex. You will not hold the same genes as everyone else, but there will be a clear lineage for your genes, a general explanation for their existence, and gene pools are generally organizable.

&gt;﻿I have NO IDEA how to get from ""here"" to ""there"", I just see the ""there"" (an idealistic society) and it looks so beautiful! I see so much potential in my mind, but then I look around and see patents that prevent widespread access of life-saving medication.

I don't have all the answers, but I always think about re-adjusting the entire world if you make one change. For instance, you change laws so medication is more regulated, but what does that do down the road to innovation? What does that do to companies who can't make as much profit? Would the medication have ever been discovered in the first place if it was as regulated as you're proposing?

&gt;﻿By ending capitalism/industries/etc... there is a dominance there, where some (in this case me) want to insert this way of living over another. So I guess the act of societal reform is a dominant act, regardless of the outcome! This was kind of eye opening for me, so thanks for sharing that! 

Absolutely. Two other examples of strong-handed moves that you may see as equalizing but are not include: government subsidies and monetary regulation.

Furthermore, communism was a complete myth. Actual communism is just tribalism by another name. You would have small groups of people, maybe 150, living together and independently from everyone else. Eventually violent tribes would come to dominate and form larger tribes and settlements, and after enough years, we'd return right back to where we are. Marx's ""progression of societies"" was complete rubbish. Of course, no ""communist"" country attempted actual communism. It was just state authoritarianism with a repressed economy and repressed culture. I'm just saying that you should call a spade a spade. No matter what you do, you're granting and restricting freedoms to people.

﻿The same is beginning to happen in Western nations, but hopefully a free market with an absence of social justice B.S. will prevail. This would be step 1 of a discussion into pragmatism: I am someone who believes in a better way of doing things, thus putting me solidly in camp #3, but I appreciate the value of competition towards reaching those optimal values. I think it is better when people choose the superior way rather than being forced to. I will stand up and argue with anyone over the more ""right"" way, but I won't enforce all of it on others. I'd just enforce the core, which would let the rest follow. That would essentially be encouraging Western values around the world and practicing a free market at home.

My experience goes back aways, but our lab was so laid-back that when I arrived at 9:30 am, I made the coffee in time for the boss and the two post-docs to show up. I planned my work so I generally got everything done by 5:00 and then I went home for an evening with the family. We had quarterly reviews of our research, so when write-up time came along, most of the work was done. If I wasn't so fucking dirt-poor supporting a family on a tiny stipend, I would have had the time of my life. 

I had a dead-easy project. The student preceding me had discovered a new protein in the cell walls of bacteria, and my job was to purify it, characterize it, and develop an assay for it. In those days, 'characterize' didn't mean sequence and three dimensional structure, because the tools weren't available. 

At the other end of the spectrum, some labs were slave galleys, with students expected to work from 8 am to 8 or 10 pm. The boss might drop in on a Sunday evening to make sure everyone was in the lab. 

When I did my second post-doc, it was the exact opposite. It was in the (then) very competitive field of bacteriophage genetics, and there was a continual state of haste and tension in the lab.

"Do this with a fridge instead of a freezer and you could probably save a little bit of electricity this way. Though you would need rather a lot of ammonium nitrate to make much of a difference. This would take up a significant amount of space in the fridge, which is obviously less than ideal.

It would almost certainly not be of any benefit to a freezer though. Ammonium nitrate dissolving in water does indeed get cold, perhaps down to about -10 ^o C, but not much colder than that. But even a cheap domestic freezer goes down to -20 ^o C and most go colder still, down to anywhere between -20 and -40 ^o C.

The major problem you will have is regenerating solid ammonium nitrate again. It is extremely soluble in water - more than 1 kilogram will dissolve per litre of water, even at 0 ^o C. It is also deliquescent as a solid, meaning that if left open to the atmosphere, it sucks up water vapour so voraciously that it will dissolve itself in the water it absorbs from the air.

So just leaving the solution in a bowl to evaporate at room temperature is not going to work, even in a hot room. You would need to heat the solution to well above room temperature to drive enough water off to regenerate solid ammonium nitrate. This would obviously take energy to do - far more energy than you would ever save by using it to cool down your fridge.

However, if you used a solar concentrator (such as a concave parabolic mirror) as the source of heat for drying out the ammonium nitrate, then you would be using a renewable energy source. That way, you wouldn't be using any electricity or fossil fuels for that step, so you could potentially save money overall. Though it would probably be better to just use a solar photovoltaic panel to generate electricity to run the fridge - that would be a lot simpler, involve far less work and probably be cheaper.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"2016 marks my 20th year as an analytical chemist (holy crap, 20?) and my career has included a handful of temp jobs, grad school, and my current long-term employer. Based on the way you phrased the questions I'm thinking you want an industrial position rather than teaching so I'll direct the comments in that direction.

Trust me when I say it really boils down to how much you like doing lab work. Particularly if you're into environmental chem there's going to be a fair bit of analytical benchwork, but if you're good with the instruments and the sample prep it'll be fine. Some people love the classes but are ""meh"" about labs, but I felt the other way and it's turned into a decent career. 

Every job I've had that wasn't a temp job (or grad school) was a typical 9-5 job with benefits and a decent, professional work environment. It doesn't pay as well as some businesses, but I genuinely like my colleagues and my work IS interesting. Job security can be a significant issue, but the riskier jobs tend to pay better so that can balance out somewhat. Two more things to consider. First, you will likely need to move for work unless you're already located in a ""hot"" area for chemistry. Second, grad school should be on the table.

I disagree with your assertion that w/v is scientifically incorrect especially as it is widely used and widely taught.  I see w/v used regularly in teaching labs (when dispensing a liquid) while in industry I almost never saw anyone use w/v.  I do agree that w/v shouldn't be used as much as it is but it appears to be difficult to stop.  It does have its place as a simple way of defining how much of two materials you are using.  You just have to know that it is only usable in those very specific edge cases and not for when making up every single different combination of solutions you want to analyze.  Basically it's good for doing the same test over and over again with no changes at all and all the conversions were done before any measuring.  It becomes a problem in these situations where the person who developed the method is gone and no one knows what they did to set it up.  So I guess I do agree with you to a point...its just that it's easier to pipette a liquid out repeatedly than it is to weigh it out and people are lazy in their math.,chemistry,2,1200.0

"This is not quite MO theory, which tends not to use hybridized atomic orbitals (sp,sp2,sp3 etc) except maybe as a starting point if you're constructing an MO diagram by hand.

An sp2 orbital is an orbital formed by combing an s-orbital and 2 p-orbitals, while an sp3 is formed similarly by using an s and 3 p-orbitals. Hybrid atomic orbitals are nice for thinking about bonding because they have nice geometries and are very directional, having most of the electron density on one side of the atom, compared to a p-orbital that is symmetric.

Hybrid atomic orbitals can be thought of as inheriting some proportion of their precursor orbitals' character. An sp2 orbital is 66% p-orbital, while an sp3 orbital is 75% p-orbital. For stabilizing a cation, you want to be able to donate some electron density to the electron deficient site, which p-character is better at than s-character. ",chemistry,1,1200.0

"Here's a long joke, but it's worth the read:

Three friends, seeking great fortune, visit a newly discovered pyramid. Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used. It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room. In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns, ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another. In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door. In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit. Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off. A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful. Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high-tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance. The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and the night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in the frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friend's horror, the door began to crack. With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried. BOOM The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid, and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust. The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""",pcmasterrace,0,1200.0

After completing my course/teaching requirements in the first and second year, all of my time has been spent designing and running experiments and purifying products. When I am not at my bench, I spend my time either perusing all relevant journals to stay current on literature or searching SciFinder/Reaxxys for any reactions I am thinking about. I currently do not have an undergraduate, but when I did, I would spend about 20 h each week supervising them and helping them understand their project. 

If you are at a good school and work for a well-established faculty member, then you should have a similar experience. Graduate students do not usually teach later in their career unless their PI is not well funded. Other divisions tend to work less than synthetic organic labs. 

One thing that is vital once you join a lab is to learn as much as you can from the senior members in the lab before they leave. There is a lot of expertise there, and most are happy to help you when you are doing something new. Even if you think you know how to do a given technique, ask an older student how to do it to see if they know a better way than you do. 

If you join a larger lab or a lab for a ""big wig"" then you should not expect to have daily (or weekly) interaction with your adviser. Older members in the group are typically expected to mentor younger students for day-to-day problems. ",chemistry,2,1200.0

If you're in the lab of a PI who's famous or well-respected in the field and publishes a lot, you can expect to balance multiple responsibilities, multiple projects, and have to multitask.

The problem is probably just that it was quenched too quickly. So if I understand you then you ARE simply removing the ether supernatant that contains your product.

I would just add 1N NaOH or saturated Rochelle's salt (slowly) and just let it stir vigorously for several hours at rt while I do other stuff.

"A salt of some description is required, the more soluble the better. With concrete, is it the sodium content or the chloride content which does the damage?

If the sodium content is the problem, then use calcium chloride instead. This is more soluble anyway, so is more effective than sodium chloride. Most commercial road de-icing salt is calcium chloride - it is available cheaply in large quantities, since it is a byproduct of the Solvay process and has few other uses.

If the chloride content is the problem, then use sodium acetate or sodium nitrate. These are more soluble still than either sodium chloride or calcium chloride, so should be even more effective.

If both ions from sodium chloride together cause the damage to concrete, then choose a salt which contains neither. An ideal example would be ammonium nitrate. This is extremely soluble in water, so should be the most effective one mentioned so far.

**An important safety tip:** If you do use a stove extractor hood to absorb chlorine gas from the air, you should replace the carbon filter immediately afterwards - do not expose it to cooking heat, since that could cause some of the chlorine to be released.

My brother had a friend who worked for best buy geek squad. He gave my brother his old laptop and told him the HD was failing. It wasn't the HD, it was the battery. The battery would cut out and lose power, so the computer would instantly power off instead of doing a safe force shutdown/hibernate. So obviously the HD would 'corrupt' when that happened. Which was repaired by him using the factory image. 

He wasn't a bad guy, he just didn't know that much about computers. He didn't even chkdsk, or consider that the HD was corrupting due to the power loss. 

I mean I get how its difficult to troubleshoot power issues over the phone. When i first got it it looked like a HD issue, since the drive wouldn't boot and chkdsk repaired errors. But when the damn machine turns off instantly without warning instead of doing a force shutdown, then it shows as corrupt. It should be really really obvious that its a power issue.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)

Two molecules can have the exact same number of atoms in them, even the bonds (which atom binds to which other atom) can be the same, but as you can see in the first image (with the two hands), the two molecules can still be different due to the arrangement of the bonds with respect to each other. (Different meaning here that there is no way [by rotating the bonds] to exactly make Molecule A look like Molecule B; in the image: if you rotate the left molecule by 180 degrees, the arrangement of the 3 chemical groups will be different, because the ""order"" of the three groups [COOH, R, NH2] is different). It is sometimes hard (even for chemists) to envision these rotations in 3D.

D- and L- are just one of the many ways to not only show, that there IS a difference, but also to specify which of the two possible forms (isomers) is actually meant.

As Lucciiv said, some molecules have completely different effects on the human body depending on their stereochemistry (which is the blanket term for these differences between molecules). For some drugs one of the form is active in the body, while the other is inactive, for others one can even be bad for you, while the other can have a positive effect.",chemistry,5,1200.0

"No, you don't form chloramines by reacting bleach with paper. Chloramines are formed by bleach reacting with nitrogenous organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins or urea from urine. Paper is mostly cellulose, which contains no nitrogen, so cannot form chloramines when treated with bleach.

Also, I did not say that chlorine was already present. I said that **if** you have chlorine present, it will be a gas, because elemental chlorine is a gas at room temperature.

Bleach does contain chlorine, but in the form of sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl. A small amount of dissolved elemental chlorine is present in bleach as a residue from the manufacturing process, and it is this which accounts for the chlorine smell of bleach.

The normal oxidation process of bleaching involves the decomposition of sodium hypochlorite to sodium chloride plus oxygen - it is the oxygen content which does the oxidizing.

But under certain conditions, sodium hypochlorite can decompose in different ways. For example, mixing bleach with hydrochloric acid can cause the release of chlorine gas by the following reaction:

NaOCl + **2** HCl -----&gt; NaCl + H*_2_*O + Cl*_2_*

Mixing bleach with household ammonia causes the release of chloramines by progressive chlorination of ammonia:

NaOCl + NH*_3_* -----&gt; NaOH + NH*_2_*Cl

NaOCl + NH*_2_*Cl -----&gt; NaOH + NHCl*_2_*

NaOCl + NHCl*_2_* -----&gt; NaOH + NCl*_3_*

Ammonia is of course the simplest nitrogenous compound which can be chlorinated by bleach. But of course other nitrogenous compounds can react in similar ways, though these are often more complex and slower reactions.",chemistry,2,1200.0

I'm getting the idea that this is a long-running debate, sort of smoldering away, perhaps never to be definitely resolved one way or another?  

I remember learning in undergrad o-chem that aspirin was a pro-drug for SA, bam, end of story, now go to the lab and play with esters.  Then learning in mol tox that it was an acetylating agent, end of story.

"Turkey meat (like many other meats) is a rich source of tryptophan, which is one of the essential amino acids. Extended cooking (such as boiling for 8 hours) partially breaks down the proteins in the meat, which accelerates digestion and absorption of the amino acids they are composed of.

Tryptophan is metabolized into serotonin and melatonin in the body. Serotonin is of course the neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood - many antidepressants boost serotonin levels and most such drugs can induce drowsiness. Melatonin is the hormone which controls sleep timing.

So it is quite possible that consumption of well cooked turkey could boost levels of both serotonin and melatonin in the body. It doesn't normally take effect quite so quickly as you experienced, but some people are more sensitive than others to fluctuations in their serotonin levels.

There is a possible way to test this theory. Tryptophan supplements are available in most health food shops or from online supplement stores, under the name of 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan). So if you are interested, you could obtain some of these and see if they have the same effect. They are perfectly legal and provided you are not already on antidepressants, completely safe.

Another effect of a high protein meal is to boost levels of the non-essential amino acid glutamate, which is common in meat proteins. In the brain, glutamate is metabolized into GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), another important neurotransmitter. Increased levels of GABA in the brain can cause relaxing and anti-anxiety effects - these are broadly speaking the effects of benzodiazepine drugs, which modulate GABA receptors in the brain. So this could contribute to the somnolent effects of a high-protein meal.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"I'm not trying to insult. Let me try to make this clear...

Going back to the three options I gave, if you are in support of #3, you are seeking a monoculture end result. This would be a complete dominance takeover. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are in support of #1, you are in support of complete multiculturalism and pluralism. If you are in support of #2, you are basically a libertarian or isolationist; you simply do not want to intervene.

In all three cases, this is your general definition of freedom, which is basically the prime moral in founding a government and making any social decisions involving power. Should weak people be free? Should strong people be free? This is what everyone's answer says about their values.

What I am saying is that your definition of freedom is that the strong should be free because you sound in favor of a strong reform of society (ending capitalism, eliminating industries). This is me making it clear to you, if it wasn't already, where you stand (assuming you would like to end capitalism, et all). 

The reason I made this statement is that people generally justify the end of capitalism as a sort of move to save the weak from the strong. Quite the opposite; it is its own form of dominance. Any of the three morals (support the weak, do nothing, support the strong) are theoretically justifiable, but they are akin to religious beliefs. They are the assumptions that people take into arguments without realizing it.

Then, what I tried to do was offer an opportunity for you to clarify your opinion. What is the core reason for your previous statements about capitalism and industry?

- Do you believe that the strong should be free to oppress the weak?
- Do you have pragmatic reasons that do not concern morals, except in a calculated way?",chemistry,1,1200.0

Everything else is same, but Kf this time is the cryoscopic constant, which for water is 1.853 K kg per mol.

You might want to ask why the ""i"" for NaCl is 2. Properties like these are called colligative properties, and they depend only on the number of particles in solution.

The reason is this: s-orbitals are able to penetrate to the nucleus better because they have no node at the nucleus. Therefore, an electron in an s-orbital experiences a stronger nuclear attraction than an electron in a p-orbital of the same shell (e.g. comparing 2s to 2p).

Since electronegativity is largely based on the strength of nuclear attraction for valence electrons... more s-character means greater effective electronegativity.",chemistry,1,1200.0

But since you're not working in a cooling bath you are working against the clock of everything warming up too quickly. But you also can't add everything too quickly. Catch-22! I would prioritize the slow addition the aqueous solution over the slow addition of the ether.

"Gamma decay is NOT a pair. SPECT is a great example of an entire technique built around this. Pairs are produced due to stationary anhilation, for example a positron wandering into an electron. The reason a pair is needed in this case is that each photon has momentum (DESPITE No mass! See your original comment with edits as it is incorrect), and the momentum needs to be soaked up by something.

Single gamma decay is usually the result of a metastable state that the nucleus ends up in where it needs to relax by release a photon. This is a bit like an excited atom or bond relaxing by having an electron jump to a lower energy state by releasing a photon, but on a much higher energy scale. The most common SPECT decay for instance is Tc-99m -&gt; Tc-99, which releases a single gamma ray but sends the nucleus flying a bit. As to how many bonds, well, it has 0.14 MeV of energy, so a lot. Hundreds or thousands in fact, depend on how much energy it deposits in each one, and how many additional bonds each of those breaks afterwards.

"I would agree with most of that. I take the point that saturated fats aren't necessarily worse for health in general than unsaturated fats. However, saturated fats do have a higher energy value, so contribute more calories to your overall intake than unsaturated fats.

Animal fats tend to contain higher proportions of longer chain fatty acids than vegetable fats, which is why they have higher melting points and greater thermal stability. The longer the fatty acid chain, the higher the calorific value of a fat containing it. Which means than animal fats contribute more calories to your overall intake than vegetable fats.

So even if you ignore everything else, the energy content (calorific value) of saturated fats or animal fats makes them worse for the diet than unsaturated or vegetable fats. Just by the basic principle that the greater your caloric intake, the more likely you are to become overweight. As far as I'm aware, that simple principle hasn't yet been disproved or overthrown.

"I don't do forensic chemistry, but I do work on sensors. Without knowing the exact methods they used, it's difficult to know exactly if this is right or wrong. 

Most likely scenario is they created a bunch of mixtures with different EDTA concentrations and compared the sample to those. This isn't ideal, as you need repeated tests to be able to state your results with any confidence, but in this scenario you don't need an absolute detection limit, you can simply give the concentration as above or below a certain concentration (e.g. EDTA was not present in the sample at concentrations &gt;1 p.p.m.). This works if you are looking for a certain concentration, but not for trace amounts.

If all you are looking for is trace amounts, then you do need to be aware of your detection limits. However, working out your detection limits is by far the most laborious part of any sensing techniques. It is entirely possible that the analysts involved had good reasons to be confident in their result, but simply did not have the time to fully establish the limits of the technique. So even for trace analysis, the lack of a detection limit doesn't mean the evidence is bad, just not ideal. That said, normally detection techniques have to be considered well established before they are allowed to used in court.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"Provided that absolutely nothing from the circuit boards could corrode and dissolve in the water, then technically yes. Completely pure water is indeed non-conductive, but it is extremely difficult to actually obtain water in a perfectly pure state. Even traces of salts (from fingerprints, for example) on anything you immerse in the water or on the container you put the water in can cause the water to become conductive.

It really doesn't take much to lower the resistance. Once that has happened and current begins to flow, the water becomes partially ionized, lowering the resistance even further. Temperature also plays a part - even perfectly pure water is significantly conductive if heated anywhere near boiling point.

Having said that, whether a circuit would survive depends a lot on the voltages running through it. Anything using mains voltage (120 volts in the USA or 240 volts in Europe) would be extremely sensitive and probably wouldn't survive.

But low power devices running on a couple of AA cells (so about 3 volts) would in all likelihood be fine. Such as a TV remote - they can often survive being dropped in the bath and work just fine again once dried out.

Mobile phones (cellphones) are notorious for being killed by water. But it isn't short-circuiting that kills them - after all, most phone batteries produce less than 6 volts. So unless dropped in seawater (which is obviously far more conductive due to the salt), very little current will flow through the water itself. Water damage to a phone is usually by corrosion of sensitive components or water getting between layers within the screen, damaging the LCD.",chemistry,17,1200.0

"If this was some very tricky crystallization, I could maybe believe it. Crystallizations typically need a point of nucleation, which could be provoked by a particle of dust. So it could have been that the new lab was just too clean, and needed some dust in it for a successful crystallization to work.

Or perhaps an experiment needed a tiny trace of a certain obscure compound as a catalyst to make it work. Nobody knew what it was, but a bottle of it had been spilled on the floor years before and every flask in the lab ended up with a tiny amount inside it, just from dust settling from the air.

Or, and this is a bizarre possibility, the experiment required a certain amount of radioactivity to work. Maybe the old lab had previously been used for research into radioactive substances and therefore had radioactive dust. So the new lab would not have had that - at least not at first.

Although that last one is rather unlikely. I used to work in a lab which handled uranium, though only a few grams at any one time. We of course had a Geiger counter to check for radiation.

"On the molecular level, the polystyrene is behaving like a sponge, soaking up the acetone and physically expanding as it does so. I know it doesn't look like it is expanding when you stick polystyrene foam into a beaker of acetone - it actually appears to be shrinking. But that is because the individual little foam balls of polystyrene are being disrupted.

These start off as tiny little solid beads with pentane in their cores, which boils when heated and acts as the blowing agent to expand the polystyrene into a foam. Most of the pentane vapour is still trapped in the foam, so this gets dissolved by the acetone, which is partially how the foam is disintegrated by solvent.

But once you have that gelled blob of semi-solid polystyrene with acetone, it will shrink and harden as the acetone evaporates from it. Then it will soften and expand again if you put it back in a beaker of more acetone. So you can think of this as acetone dissolving into the polystyrene.

A similar process happens if you drop a solid rubber object (like a bung or septum) into a beaker of dichloromethane or similar chlorinated solvent. The rubber swells up, sometimes to several times its original size, but it doesn't dissolve. The solvent is ""dissolved"" into the rubber, which then expands to account for this.",chemistry,6,1200.0

"I actually did know that. The excess oil does cut down the amount of unreacted alkali in the finished soap, but doesn't reduce it to zero. This is because the saponification reaction never goes to 100% completion. So even if you use a massive excess of oil, there will still be some unreacted alkali present. A very small amount in most cases, but it is still there.

Also, even if you take a 100% pure soap (pure sodium stearate, for example) and dissolve it in water, you end up with a partially alkaline solution. This is because any soap is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. When such a salt is dissolved in water, it partially hydrolyses back to the free weak acid plus NaOH, or KOH if it was a potassium soap.",chemistry,22,1200.0

"Whatever else it may be, it's not rock salt. A solution of that should just sit there. If it were a glass etchant like fluoride or alkali, the whole interior of the glass would be cloudy wherever the solution was in contact. It wouldn't crack cleanly like that. 

Try filling one of the unused glasses with salt water using purified salt from the grocery store. This will eliminate the glass, or a weakness in the glass casting, as the source of the problem. 

There are a number of tests you can do to figure out what that 'rock salt' consists of, but some of them require a properly equipped laboratory. 

If  you put a drop of the rock salt solution on a piece of plate glass, let it dry, and then wash the glass, does it leave a permanent etch mark on the glass? If so, then it's either strong alkali or a fluoride salt. Either way, inedible. 

Whatever else you do, don't use the salt for cooking until you know more. This is beyond strange.

"There is a possibility which nobody else has really touched on - you could be suffering from heavy metal poisoning from solder somewhere on the pipework.

Traditionally, solder was a lead-tin alloy. But this has fallen out of fashion because of the lead, so now, lead-free solders are used. There are various different alloys used in replacement of lead. Some are mostly tin with about 1% copper. Some contain bismuth or silver instead of lead.

But another one commonly used in water plumbing contains antimony. While this is not so toxic as lead, it isn't completely harmless and could cause the kind of symptoms you are experiencing.

Believe it or not, pills made of pure antimony metal were once sold as a cure for constipation, and were intended to be re-used. This was a long time ago, before the invention of flushing toilets, so you re-used the pill by fishing it out of your excrement, washing it and taking it again when required. A microscopic amount of antimony would dissolve from the pill to form the active dose, so a typical pill would last many years even with daily use.

Of course, anything which cures constipation can in principle cause diarrhea. So it is quite possible that the water system in your house has at least one solder joint made with an antimony-containing solder. It has probably taken a couple of years for the solder to be degraded by water flow, so now enough antimony could be dissolving in the water to cause your symptoms.

There is an easy way to check if this is the problem. Send another water sample to a testing lab, but ask them to specifically test for antimony content. It is extremely unlikely that water could be contaminated by antimony from a ground or bedrock source, so if antimony is present, it is almost certainly from a solder joint.",chemistry,7,1200.0

The normal purpose is for waterproofing fabrics, but a layer of silicone is good for repelling just about anything except solvents which can dissolve it. It is notorious for repelling paint, so it could easily stop your adhesive sticking to metal. You may need to replace the coating fairly frequently, but you can get Fabsil in large aerosols which are not too expensive. You can also buy it in unpressurized cans if you want to paint it on with a brush, to avoid silicones going where you don't want them.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"It really depends on what is defined by an adverse effect. Since antimony isn't well absorbed from the gut and therefore needs a rather high dose to cause the classical symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, it may be that the emetic or purgative effects were either overlooked or not considered to be adverse. Besides which, it doesn't take much to cause said effects - the amount leached into a small cup of water overnight is clearly an ample quantity, if medical history is to be believed.

Also, there is plenty of evidence that antimony has been used in solder.

"You're half right - salt does raise the boiling point, but it lowers the freezing point to significantly below zero. The greater the concentration of salt in the water, the greater the effect - a strong solution will have a higher boiling point and lower freezing point than a weak solution.

Remember that in a solution, the salt is separated into individual Na^+ and Cl^- ions, each of which are surrounded by water molecules. The water molecules are more strongly attracted to the ions than they are to other water molecules by hydrogen bonding.

In order for a salt solution to freeze, the water has to arrange itself into a close-packed, highly ordered crystal structure. The salt interferes with the packing, making the structure more disordered than it would be for pure water ice. The overall structure is therefore weaker, so it takes less energy to break it up into a liquid. Which means that more heat energy must be removed to freeze it.

For any liquid to boil, the energy of the molecules it is composed of must have sufficient energy to completely separate from each other and become a gas. Which means that the molecules must have enough energy to overcome any attractive forces between each other. In water, this means hydrogen bonding. In a salt solution, you have additional bonding - the attractive forces between water molecules and the salt ions. Which means that on average, more energy must be supplied to the water in order for the molecules to overcome the extra attractive forces and escape as steam.

The substance dissolved in the water doesn't necessarily need to be an ionic compound to have a similar effect. Sugar solutions behave in a similar manner, and sugar is a completely covalent compound. It has the same sort of effect because sugar has lots of OH groups - 5 for glucose or 8 for sucrose. Which means that there is a lot of hydrogen bonding present - sugar holds onto water molecules quite strongly.

For boiling a sugar solution, the same is true as for a salt solution - the extra attractive forces caused by the hydrogen bonding between sugar molecules and water molecules means that more energy must be supplied to completely free up the water molecules into the gaseous state. The effect becomes greater as water is boiled off - as more water is lost as steam, the concentration of the remaining solution increases, so the boiling point increases. Which is an effect used when making toffee or fudge - you can calculate the water content of a boiling syrup by measuring the temperature at which it boils.

For freezing a sugar solution, the same is also true up to a point - the sugar interferes with the crystal packing of ice. Sugar solutions have been used as antifreeze at certain times in the past.

However, sugar can be made to mix with water in any proportion if enough heat is supplied to force the mixing. If you have a solution containing more sugar than water, then the point at which it appears to freeze can be higher than zero - quite a lot higher for high proportions of sugar. However, even though it appears to be solid, it isn't really frozen. Concentrated sugar solutions behave like an amorphous glass and are technically still liquid - toffee can flow like a thick liquid, just very slowly.",chemistry,6,1200.0

"Well, if it's 'noninsulated' the metallic connections are exposed to the water, right?  So here's what happens:  a small current will flow through 100% distilled water, because it's not a PERFECT insulator, the current is carried by H*_3_*O^+ and OH^- ions which are always present due to the self-ionization of water.  So assuming there are at least 2 uninsulated electrical connections with a voltage between them, a small current will flow.

The negative connection will simply give electrons to the positive H*_3_*O^+ ions, giving off H*_2_* gas bubbles.  Mostly harmless, unless they accumulate somewhere and build up pressure and burst things/burn.  

On the other hand, bad things happen at the positive connection.  Electrons can be removed from OH^- ions giving oxygen gas, but this is energetically difficult.  More likely, electrons will be removed from the metal of the connection itself - copper, tin, lead, aluminum, whatever - and the now-positive metal atoms go into solution as ions.

As the ions go into solution, the solution will in turn become more conductive.  Eventually you have a very conductive, colorful solution in place of pure water, and your electrical interconnects are all corroded away!

"A centrifuge is basically just a heavily reinforced rotor which can spin extremely fast. A laboratory centrifuge will have mountings on the rotor to fit commonly used vessels into. Such as test tubes or boiling tubes for a small centrifuge, or large beakers or buckets for a bigger one.

Usually there are either two or four mountings. If there are two, then they will be opposed, at 180 ^o to each other. If there are four, they will be 90 ^o to each other. The mountings are also pivoted, allowing the tubes or buckets to swing outwards and become horizontal when the rotor is spinning.

When spinning at high speed, the centrifugal force generated simulates a massive increase in gravity on the mountings and anything mounted in them. This causes rapid settling of the contents according to density.

For example, if you did a reaction which produced a very fine powdery precipitate which you wanted to isolate from a liquid, you could use a centrifuge to force the solid precipitate down to the bottom of your test tubes. Then you could just pour the liquid off afterwards.

In a medical setting, centrifuges are often used to separate the components of blood. Which is a complex mixture, containing red cells, white cells, platelets, proteins, fats and plasma. When subjected to a centrifuge, all these separate out. If I remember correctly, you get white cells at the bottom - they are heaviest. Then red cells above them. Then platelets and other proteins. Then the clear liquid plasma, with fats right at the top.

The most important aspect of using a centrifuge, whether using a small or large machine, is to balance the rotor. So if you have only one sample you want to spin down, you have to weigh it and then put another sample the same weight (of water, for example) in the mounting opposite, for balancing.

An unbalanced centrifuge is extremely dangerous - the forces involved can generate powerful vibrations and destroy the machine. Think about how much a washing machine vibrates on its spin cycle when the drum isn't balanced properly, and those rarely go faster than 1000 rpm. A centrifuge can spin 10 or 100 times faster than any washing machine, which magnifies the forces involved. There are many stories to be found about large centrifuges which someone forgot to balance bouncing around the lab, only stopping when they bounce far enough to pull out their power cables.",chemistry,1,1200.0

Enough antimony would dissolve in the wine to cause more or less immediate vomiting when drunk in the morning.

So if the emetic effects of antimony can be rapid, it is certainly possible that the constipation-curing (or diarrhea inducing, depending on perspective) could be similarly fast-acting.

As to your question, why would I want to potentially try this out? I'm trying to be as sulf-sufficient as possible, and I have no means of producing my own propane! I realize that propane is used for exactly what I'm trying to do, but I crunched the numbers for propane and found that in a typical growing season of 8 months I'd have to burn 244 lbs of pure propane (a little over 12 full 20-lbs tanks), the cost for which adds up quickly.

Once I really get into this self-sufficiency business and have animals (which I don't have yet), what I'll probably end up doing is building myself a methane digester, which extracts the methane from animal and plant waste decomposition. I'm assuming that methane burns just as clean (if not cleaner) than propane, so that'd be great. As for the charcoal thing, it's more something that just caught my interest at the moment and I'm trying to see if it could potentially work just for the hell of it.

"Another effect of hot water which I didn't mention before is that some fats and greases are solid in cold water. Therefore it is more difficult for soaps to dissolve them when cold. In hot water, fats and greases melt, so a soap or detergent can mix with them more effectively.

Probably the main difference with laundry soap is the additives, not the soap itself. Before laundry specific soaps were invented, ordinary solid bars of soap were grated (with a cheese grater) into the laundry. The small flakes of soap produced by grating dissolved more easily than a large bar and made a more homogeneous solution.

Modern washing powders exploit a similar effect, though the granules are even smaller than grated soap, so dissolve faster still.
Traditional soaps are sodium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. But modern detergents are alkylbenzene sulfonate salts, which are more soluble than traditional soaps. So these can dissolve faster and form more concentrated solutions.

But the additives have a significant effect. Sodium percarbonate is added as a bleaching (oxidizing) agent. This is really just hydrated sodium carbonate with one of the molecules of water in the crystal structure replaced by a molecule of hydrogen peroxide.

This acts as a stable, solid source of peroxide. When it dissolves, the peroxide is released into solution. The sodium carbonate also dissolves, forming an alkaline solution. It is possible to wash clothes with sodium carbonate alone, hence why it is also referred to as washing soda.

Other commonly used additives are sodium phosphate, sodium polyphosphate, citric acid or EDTA. The purpose of these is to chelate to soluble calcium or magnesium, keeping those ions in solution. This is for two different reasons. First, it prevents calcium being deposited on washing machine heating elements as limescale. 

But more important is the prevention of soap scum. Once dissolved, soaps can combine with Ca^2+ or Mg^2+ ions to form insoluble salts, which float to the surface. This takes some of the soap out of solution and inhibits the formation of soap bubbles (lather), thereby reducing the cleaning effect.

Modern detergents and the additives all dissolve more readily in cold water than traditional soap. So this accounts for laundry soaps and washing powders being more effective in cold water than traditional soaps.",chemistry,2,1200.0

"HDR and SDR are both color depth sdr= 24b and HDR=32b. 

The game you mention is a PC exclusive. The games i mentioned are multi plat form. Monitors have had HDR for quite some time but not TVs. Consoles are made for TVs. Consoles have the ability to process in 32 bit color but they DON'T USE 32b images because 95% of the TVs out there do not display it and the overhead is unreal. Any dev who works on consoles and wastes time with 32b color images is an idiot because of the performance impact. This is one of the reasons that consoles hold PCs back. Guess how PC porting is stream lined. We get our 32b color from post processing effects on ports.

*Some* PC exclusives offer 32bit modes but most still don't use 32b images. We get our color depth from post processing.

HDR isn't special, nor is it new. My point is that HDR has nothing to do with bandwidth, color depth does, and we've had that forever.

This is why I said 4k at 120HZ in the title. HDR and color depth are the same thing.


The OP is about 1440p UW and 4K at high frame rates. HDR and color depth go hand in hand (they are the same thing.) Open up some image files from your favorite games and see what they are actually encoded in.

X-ray diffraction for protein crystallography requires larger crystals than that, simply because of the massive increase in complexity of a protein relative to a small molecule.

Neutron diffraction is a different story - that requires really big crystals, at least a centimetre in diameter is typical for that.

"There are two possible efficient methods, depending on how full the bottle is and whether you want to keep the bottle afterwards.

If the bottle is not important and is more or less full, then break the glass around the lump. Score it with a glass cutter a few times in random places around the outside. Wipe the score marks with a wet cloth - this helps to weaken the glass. Then place the bottle inside a large plastic container, such as a bucket or washing up bowl. Hit with a hammer a few times, enough to fracture the glass. 

Then peel the fractured glass off (be careful not to cut yourself doing this), leaving a lump of congealed copper nitrate behind. Transfer this to another container and break it up with a chisel into pieces small enough to grind with a pestle and mortar.

If there is a reasonable amount of airspace inside the bottle, then you could always dissolve the copper nitrate out with hot water - the hotter the better. Pour hot water in almost to the top, leaving an inch or two of airspace. Then put the lid on and give it a good shake to help it dissolve.

Obviously this is not ideal if you want the solid, but once you have dissolved it all out, you can concentrate the solution by boiling most of the water off, then slow-cool it to recrystallize the copper nitrate. If you do this, then what you get will probably be purer and cleaner than what was in the bottle to begin with.",chemistry,1,1200.0

"One of my favorite demonstrations, pedagogically, involves the reaction of aqueous tartrate with hydrogen peroxide (to create CO2, among other things) as catalyzed by cobalt(II).  It is best done slightly warm (maybe 60-70C), and you can see the slow production of bubbles by the uncatalyzed mixture.  Upon adding the catalyst, a truly impressive gush of bubbles comes out (usually overflowing the container).  Best of all, while aqueous cobalt(II) is red, during the reaction the solution turns green, which eventually returns to the original red color when the reaction is done - clearly demonstrating the catalyst forming the activated complex and returning unchanged afterwards.  

Another simple but effective demo is to demonstrate buffers with two burets and universal indicator.  Fill both burets with maybe 0.1M HCl.  Put deionized water in one flask and an equimolar acetic acid/acetate buffer (about 30mL, at the same conc'n as the HCl) in another flask.  Universal indicator shows that the buffer (pH 4.7-ish) starts off more acidic than the water.  Add acid to the water, and it very quickly turns deep red.  Add acid to the buffer, and the color does not change much until a considerable volume of acid is added.  So, even though the buffer started off at a lower pH, it obviously was much more resistant than the water to becoming very acidic.  (This one isn't whizbang flashy, but it does make its point pretty well.)  

I like to use glowsticks to demonstrate reaction kinetics.  Use the kind of glowstick in small, thin tubes (about 3mm diameter; I find them at the craft store), not thick ones.  Place the glowing device into ice cold water and it visibly dims.  Place another one into hot water and it becomes visibly brighter.  Having discovered this, I may never bother prepping the iodine clock reaction again.  

Le Chatelier's Principle is well demonstrated using cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate dissolved in methanol.  The hexaaquo complex of cobalt is red, and the tetrachloro complex of cobalt is blue.  If you prepare the original mixture right, it is purple (i.e. both species are present at equilibrium).  You can shove things around in some fairly obvious ways: add deionized water; add 12 M HCl (anything less has too much water and too little chloride); make the solution hotter or colder.  Some other fun tricks are to add lead(II) nitrate (to ""pull"" the equilibrium by precipitating chloride) or to add absolute ethanol (equilibrium shifts to the side with more moles of solute; a solution example of something more often discussed with gases).  

Another good demonstration of equilibrium is to mix equal volumes of, say 0.1 M lead(II) nitrate and 1 M HCl.  We have a 10-fold excess of chloride, so stoichiometry says that clearly all of the lead has been precipitated, right?  Separate the supernatant cleanly from the precipitate.  Treat the supernatant with KI and witness the brightly colored lead(II) iodide.  

Again, these aren't necessarily the flashiest demos in my arsenal, but they are some of those that most clearly illustrate the point at hand.

"Sorry, while you may have interviewed, Dow or Dupont won't start hiring until the middle of 2017. It would take at least two years for the merge to happen as well as split off again, so another wave of layoffs will be expected for the beginning of 2017, thus be prepared to compete with that pool as well.

I would suggest doing post docs for PIs that ARE well connected if you want to go to industry. Start expanding your horizons instead of the east coast. And take advantage of  your analytical chemistry as that area is still lucrative in industry. I'm pretty sure that Incyte is hiring for PhD analytical chemists. In addition, patent law and working for a consulting company are the little known, but very profitable areas. I know a few that have done that without doing a post doc. Companies will pay you to study for the bar and get a patent license. It may be difficult for you and your SO to obtain industry jobs in the same area. I know one couple that live in the middle of Maryland while one commutes to Wilmington and the other commutes to Baltimore. I have no idea how they do it.

"""Dry beaning"" or cold extraction is the technique that the homebrewer in my post used.

Multiple days would give a stronger, and possibly depending on taste an overwhelming, coffee flavor.  Also it is notable that they were only using 1 ounce of whole beans, therefore they were able to develop the flavors from only a handful of coffee beans.

"Don't wedge chunks or granules of dry ice right next to bottles of liquid, whether they are glass or plastic, because they will freeze. A carbonated drink will probably then crack open a plastic bottle or shatter a glass one.

The best idea is to have your dry ice at the top of the cooler box, separated from the drinks in the bottom by several layers of towels or similar fabric. If you have a big solid chunk, break it up into smaller pieces. If you have pellets or granules, use them as they are, wrapped up in a towel. That way, the bottles of drink won't be in direct contact with the dry ice. But plenty of cold carbon dioxide gas will sink to the bottom of the cooler and nicely chill your drinks.

If you have some dry ice left over by the time you have some empty plastic bottles, you could make some time-delay explosions by filling a bottle with bits of dry ice, then screwing the top on and throwing it as far away from your campsite as possible. Or dig a hole in the sand and bury a bottle full of dry ice. As it warms up, the pressure in the bottle will build until it bursts.

"A classic example of 'radiosynthesis' is perbromate (BrO*_4_*^-).  An elusive oxyanion - long after perchlorate and periodate had been made, nobody had managed to isolate perbromate.

The 'break' was that selenate (SeO*_4_*^-2) could be prepared from the unstable isotope Se83, with a half life of 24 minutes.  Giving off a beta particle (electron), it became BrO*_4_*^- !  Unfortunately the new bromine atom was also an unstable isotope, so the perbromate didn't hang around very long - but long enough to be characterized, which assisted future efforts to prepare it.

"If we are predicting the mechanism, how does this sound:

Nucleophilic S attacks at one of the ethylene carbons, thereby cleaving that C--O bond. The heat decarboxylates it to leave behind an unbranched compound: NCSCCOH. This could then undergo a cyclicization with the O attacking the cyano C; N temporarily pulls away electrons to form a 5-membered ring intermediate. N^- then donates back the electrons to reform cyano group and eject a nucleophilic S and would look like so: HSCCOCN. The nucleophilic S can attack the 2nd C from the left to form the thiirane product and the cyanate.",chemistry,2,1200.0

There is a whole group of compounds responsible for what I want to control and the literature uses liquid chromatography to separate them, and analyse this at 325nm so yes, an UV lamp. However, one of the components is clearly dominant and the concentration of the minor components correlate with the concentration of the major component so I just want to focus on that guy. However, I assume that 325nm is just a catch-all in between wavelength they use, could be wrong though. So step one would be to analyse the spectrum around it to locate the exact wavelength of the highest peak, so I can observe THAT wavelength and maximise the S/N ratio, but if that all fails, its definitely detectable with 325nm.

"Oh, so that's even better. The PI has no idea how you're doing in classes. Your graduate student will not care. Research has nothing to do with how ""book smart"" you are. In fact, some of the most intelligent people I've seen were quite stupid when it came to research. Completely unoriginal and not creative at all - all they could do was memorize and regurgitate information. Which works for many professions but not for research scientists. Research is all about pushing the boundaries and coming up with innovative ideas that have not been tried before. 

So in short, your Orgo 2 grade/performance will not correlate with how good of a researcher you are/will become and your graduate student definitely knows that. As long as you can talk intelligently about your project and offer good insights, he/she will not care. ",chemistry,3,1200.0

"If the entire atom is moving, then relative to the nucleus the electron orbitals will still be stationary.  The entire atom or molecule will get [contracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction), but I don't think this would affect any bonding because relative to the nuclei, the electron clouds aren't moving (any more than they would be if the atom was at rest).  That is to say, your electron clouds might get contracted, but the nucleus, along with any other nuclei and electron clouds in the same molecule, will also be equally contracted.

However, you might be interested to know that relativistic effects on inner-sphere electrons in heavy metals are responsible for many of the unusual properties of heavy transition metals.  Atoms with a high nuclear charge can cause electrons in smaller orbitals (that are close to to the nucleus) to accelerate to relativistic speeds, causing their mass to increase and consequently causing the s orbitals to contract.  Contracting the s- and p-orbitals in this fashion increases the shielding to the more diffuse d- and f-orbitals, causing them to expand because they feel less effective nuclear charge.  It sounds crazy, but it's the reason, for example, that gold has its characteristic color and mercury its unusual state of matter.  In fact, as my professor told us, if someone ever asks you ""why does &lt;&lt;random heavy metal&gt;&gt; have &lt;&lt;unusual property&gt;&gt;?"", you have a decent chance of guessing right if you just say ""because of relativistic effects"".

So while relativistic motion of the *entire* atom doesn't really change anything as long as the entire molecule in question is along for the ride, relativistic effects do come out clearly in the heavier transition metals.",chemistry,39,1200.0
"Great story! Ester synthesis is a great lab, and I love that you did it using supplies that can be bought at regular store. 

I used to do an ester synthesis lab for my senior chemistry classes and we did use concentrated sulfuric acid as the catalyst. I used a pump that would aliquot a predetermined amount of volume, so all the students had to do was insert their test tube into the nozzle that the acid came out, and give it a gentle pump. We also did it in a fume hood.

I know my PI is really interested in getting a reproducible method down, so I'm taking the next couple weeks to really absorb as much as I can from the previous person's work. From there my plan is to jump in and try to reproduce it, although some of the procedures/techniques I'll probably add onto or tweak a bit. 

Another option is to ask your PI for a meeting, express your concerns, and present two or three directions to go in. If you bring data to the table, and have an idea of what you could do/change, I think your PI will be responsive and helpful (at least I hope so!).
