"I gotta dig it up... it was a book that someone on here linked for me to read. The goal was to react to Japan pursuing a 50,000 ton Battleship with 18"" guns, as well as the US plans for the South Dakota class. UK Admiralty then laid out plans for a 4 turret 18"" 60,000 ton vessel, or a 6 turret 16"" 55,000 ton vessel. The 6 turret ship was the leader until some limitations (like where they would be able to build it) came into play as well as the start of the treaty in 1922. After that, it was reduced to a 3 turret 16"" with 2 up front and one after of the conning tower (N3 class). Then reduced further to what became the Nelson class. ",1100.0

"This guide is only ever useful on games or applications where it's impossible to find out the Ip address of the server otherwise if no one knows it.

However, FFXIV is far from that. A simple visit to arrstatus will tell you the IP of any server in the game which you can then simply ping from cmd line.

Cmdline is also very limited so if you want to know when your connection drops (packet loss etc), instead of using tcping -t -b 3 -i 5 which really isn't that helpful when you're playing the game and not staring at your cmd line.

In this case, I don't think that donors are ignorant so much as they are subjects of a particular way of thinking. There is a very well-established practice of having missionaries travel to Western churches to present their work and raise money.

-White Anglo-Saxon Protestants are the superior race, any religious and ethnic minorities are to be tolerated (but not treated equally) only for their exploitation

-American Exceptionalism is the superior belief, and the United States (it's idealized form, at least) is the superior nation

"Get yourself a DSLR, preferably one with a crop factor instead of a full frame one. Something like Nikon's D7200 or the Canon 7D Mk II. For the Nikon, you're looking at about an RRP of over $1,000.

Next, put on it the longest lens you can. To get the zooming, you'll want a zoom lens rather than a prime, but a prime would get better quality at the same focal length. Something like Nikon's 80–400 mm f/4–5.6 (which goes for about $1,900).

But that's still probably not going to be enough. You'll want to add a teleconverter on top. It's basically something that multiplies the focal length (the zoom amount) by a certain amount. Nikon sells them in 1.4, 1.7, and 2x. You're looking on the order of a couple hundred dollars.

All this is somewhat speculative though. I don't really know if even that is enough to get the amount of zoom in this photo.",1100.0

"Agree, and I think the pressure on Rouge One is going to be immense. Other than the Clone Wars this will be the first Star Wars movie to hit the theaters that isn't directly tied to the main Skywalker story line. Either way Disney is going to pump out movies until they stop making money but the quality of Rouge One will affect perceptions of future side-movies IMO. If they hit it out of the park fans will be reassured that the franchise is in good hands, and that the franchise can produce a new, original movie that doesn't heavily borrow from the OT like TFA did (even though TFA was awesome). If Rouge One is mediocre to bad then I think future side movies will be met with a lot of skepticism. 

This is uncharted territory for the brand....this is the most exciting time to be a Star Wars fan in history, it is both thrilling and a bit scary at the same time.

The reason is indeed the accented characters. Not only do we use the additional keys, we also have the brackets and such moved to the alt layer, to accomodate for some more.

No mods (right in the alpha keys): `ù` `é` `è` `à` `ç`

Combination with `^` key (consecutive strokes): ê û î â ô

You want at least some of the bottom of the meat sitting in the liquid for a long, slow braise.  The meat juices should mix in and you'd have a big slowcooker full of yum.

"Realise that there are always trade-offs. There are limited resources and Mother Nature (if you'll permit some anthropomorphising) has to make choices: sure, you can have an animal awake more hours of the day, but more energy (a limited resource) would need to be devoted to staying awake. Being awake at night also incurs challenges: seeing in low light requires specialised eyesight that also requires features that are ""expensive."" This is partly why you see organisms that have adapted to living in near or total darkness have *lost* their vision: there's nothing selecting for it, and the energy that could be used towards growing and maintaining working eyes could be re-allocated elsewhere.

So, if an organism can survive long enough to reproduce, and *doesn't* need to be awake 24/7 to do that, then what benefit is there?

But this is a completely different gun.  The compact version is really the same form, except shrunken down 15%.  It has an aluminum slide.  It is made by S&amp;W here in the USA.

That's why it fails for him, not a deficiency in the techniques themselves, he's mistaken in this regard.   If Aikido is is based around exploiting and redirecting the energy of attack he obviously never understood that on a metaphysical level where your posture, your attitude in a given situation can potentially diffuse any violence before it even happens.  So he's poached the mechanics of the techniques and embellished them with some violence for violence sake tactics to up the bad-ass factor but I don't think its really necessary.

"As a user of cast iron cookware, I certainly do know what ""seasoned"" is in this context, but when you preheat a BBQ on high for ten minutes or so, you've burned off most of the ""seasoning"" on the open grille, anyway. 

If it's stainless, and all grille, there's virtually nothing there, by the time you start cooking.

I keep the flat side of mine seasoned, but if you were cooking portabellas or some such for your guests on the open grille, the only impact on the Vegans would be psychological.

"I honestly think it'll be impossible to tell until LVG is sacked or retires. It's obvious that no one but Smalling and De Gea are playing to their full potential. Part of a managers job is to get players playing above their limits (e.g Leicester). Or at least at their limits. LVG on the otherhand has done the opposite and made 90% of the squad regress. 

To judge the actual quality of our squad now when all they're doing is following Van Gaals shit orders would be harsh. But yes, I agree that we need signings. Preferably someone to partner Smalling and a fullback. And to give Memphis and Januzaj another chance before splashing millions on a new winger. That being said, how many wingers could consistently play well in this united team? 

Contrary to the consensus, I don't think our best XI is that bad. Yes it could be better. But it's certainly good enough for a solid top 4 finish, better performances and a decent CL run (not exiting at the damn group stages).

The issue for me is our manager. ",1234.788286

"The filesystem driver abstracts the actual disk usage from the OS. Your drive might seem pretty empty in explorer, but underlying Adaptiva can have used quite some diskpace already. Sure they manage it underlying, but it's a bit annoying that you can't just check a folder's size to see cache usage, like you can in normal SCCM and in Nomad. One of my worries here is that I'm not sure if the filesystem driver issues TRIM commands to SSDs when it deletes content.

A second worry for me was simply that I have reaaaaaaaaly bad experiences with filterdrivers. They are primary BSOD generators. This alone made me nope at Adaptiva. I admit this is very subjective, but I just prefer Nomad's almost dumb simplicty over using something like a filesystem driver.",1100.0

There's no such thing as a GG anti-harassment patrol, that's just PR. GG is literally all about organised operations of harassment.

That's not really the thread I was thinking of. If I can be bothered  i'll dig it up later. I believe the one I'm thinking of is the one that announced her as a host in MST3K recently as well.

"That's like saying we can't talk about Christianity's impact on American politics without talking about Christianity in Africa. Much like Christianity in Africa has many similarities and cross-sections with American religious faith, you'll find that it's almost completely fucking irrelevant to operations and politics in the west. Indonesia is Muslim, but it is not the middle east, nor is it engaged in civil war, direct or indirect war with the west, and it is not pouring hundreds of thousands of migrants into cultures completely different to its own.

If you can read context at all, it's not difficult to parse that if somebody is talking about Muslims in the context of Western politics, it almost certainly has more to do with the faith as practiced in Arab Spring countries, North Africa and other areas engaged in terrorism, civil war, and mass migration. You can talk all you want about Indonesian Muslims but they are almost wholly irrelevant to the discussion taking place.",1246.09434

"April 2014 - bloke jumped across a dual carriageway in front of me. I laid some several feet of rubber down, but still struck the back corner of his Beamer. He got out and shouted ""You were going too fast!"" Then he phones the police while his two kids wandered around in the traffic. 

I ushered his kids back into his car and told him we just needed to exchange contact and insurance details. I told him the Police wouldn't turn up, because there were no injuries. I wrote down my details for him and wrote down his car registration for me. It took 15 minutes following him around the road before he gave me his name and phone number. He didn't know who he was insured with. The Police told him on the phone they wouldn't turn up because no-one was hurt. 

Six months later he admitted liability. Three months after that I finally got a cheque for my car, which had been a total write off. Still, I got a new car out of it. He had to pay for the hire car I had for a week, too. ",1100.0

"&gt; Parent wasn't mentioned. Only wife was.


tl;dr OP ~~completely misrepresented the issue~~ lied his ass off. 

 [OP and his wife have kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3zcns5/when_my_stayathome_wife_tells_me_its_not_her_job/cyl4ncw). 

**He** *stayed home watching the kids* for a day (i.e. what she does every single day). But he didn't do the chores she apparently *does* when she's home, because the argument started when she yelled at him for not making the bed. (It doesn't make sense that she would do that if she wasn't regularly making the beds herself.)

So this is more like, the regular hardworking stay-at-home parent gets a rare day off to hang out with friends and comes home to a messy home due to this OP who could not be bothered to do the regular chores when he was on duty. And he calls *her* a lazy moocher to the whole internet.

"Suits are suits because they have matching coats and pants (often striped, but not always). If the pants don't match the coat,  it ain't a suit.  It is still formal wear though.

 Likewise,  a tuxedo is a tux because of the stripe down the Leg, or long coat tails,  or overly broad coat collar, however that is the older style and newer tuxes look more like business coats and it's the striped pants that really give it away. 

 I didn't know this until I got a job where I actually needed a suit.  And learned about tuxes when just getting married. [For op](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/117103-soon--2)

Another idea would be to name the game based off of the goal to give a little clarity, so if the goal is just to survive maybe name it Survive Somehow, if the goal is to find a new way off the planet name it Earth-bound etc.

"Not that I necessarily think cheating should mean forfeiture of child custody, but I think it's certainly a valid argument that it should be taken into account during custody hearings. Cheaters often introduce a great deal of unnecessary turmoil into their own children's lives by disrupting their family structure with their infidelity. It's selfish on the part of the cheating parent, and harms not just their spouse, but any children between them too. That shows a callous disregard for the emotional welfare of their own children, which is certainly relevant to custody hearings. 

Our society seems far too concerned with keeping the option open for all of us to bother actually punishing people who have affairs, despite the fact that we all agree it's wrong. I don't support making it a criminal act, but I don't see anything wrong with there being a few legal consequences for it (e.g. custody/divorce proceedings). ",1100.0

The top line is decent, they have more grit than speed with Shaw up there, but Shaw's awareness and stick skills have greatly improved to earn him that spot, even if it is temporary. That being said, I like to call our top line ""The Breakaway Line"" because I feel this line has the most breakaways with the least capital.

"oh man, me too! this comic is my real life. used to have pin straight hair that required zero effort on my part. a little limp and flat (very fine) but didn't need product, air dry and looked ok in ~20 mins. blow dry if I wanted to be super fancy would take about 5. 

suddenly last year it decided to become a strange mix of straight/wavy and random tight ringlets. basically looks like I tried to curl my hair and did an awful job.

it's ok on a good hair day (so rare) but hoo boy do I miss the ease of my straight hair. curly hair is serious WORK. so many products needed and it takes hours to air dry now 😭",1100.0

RAW needs to utilize better commentary. It's the FIRST thing I'd change. JBL wouldn't be on commentary. I'd have Michael Cole sitting where Byron sits, Rene Young sitting where JBL sits, and Mauro leading the show. With Cole and Young being supportive roles.

"I actually subscribe to the theory that ki energy attacks are actually bio-electrically generated plasma and as such they have varying degrees of speed. If we go with that it should be possible to approximate the speed of the SBC based on distance between him and the mountain it hit and the impact it caused with barely any dissipation of the beam. I definitely don't have the math but I think that would be the best way to figure out the speed. 

To clarify, plasma can have its travel speed measured by calculating how much energy dissipates in the air as it travels (which is constant for pretty much all electrically contained plasma) against its surface area and also by the amount of destruction it causes compared to the distance it traveled. Bottom line is it was very, very fast and quite possibly FTL. ",1251.48449

"Sometimes we are not prepared to think about certain subjects. It all depends on your approach (much like tripping).

&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre's (1905-1980) defining preposition for the movement, ""existence precedes essence,"" rules out any ground or foundation for establishing an essential self or a human nature. When we abandon illusions, life is revealed as nothing; and for the existentialists, nothingness is the source of not only absolute freedom but also existential horror and emotional anguish. Nothingness reveals each individual as an isolated being ""thrown"" into an alien and unresponsive universe, barred forever from knowing why yet required to invent meaning. It's a situation that's nothing short of absurd. 

You might also want to check out some philosophy about skepticism or epistemology regarding existence. Keep in mind, completely sober people have also had these thoughts and written a great deal about them.

It has been proven by science that prejudice among primates is actually natural. Studies have also shown that human babies up to a a year or so can identifying differing characteristics of apes, i.e. faces of monkeys but that we lose this ability shortly there after AND after we lose the ability to differentiate we (as babies here) begin to associate negative sentiment.  The reason is failure of constant association. This is no different than the ability to differentiate  human faces and make positive or negative associations long prior to even understanding what ""race"" is.

This process is natural and based in biology. If you don't accept this most likely you will never be able to actively correct it.",1258.08531

Even through my DUI ""well its only one many people get one or should"" or keeping my job even though I missed around 10-12 days last year from being too drunk or sick to go into work. These lies continued to work for me until I started experiencing increased withdrawal symptoms. Then I could no longer rationalize my drinking as not being a problem to myself.

One thing I have learned from SD and my own personal experience is it does not matter your age when it comes to drinking and problems. I always thought I would have to drink hard for 30-40 years before having to worry about potentially  becoming an alcoholic. I can honestly now say I have had a huge drinking problem since I started drinking at 17 and was finally able to admit to myself and others that I am an alcoholic at 25.

Not necessarily. I had my clock cleaned financially after a nasty divorce from a marriage where I was the sole-income and my wife handled all the finances. She had worked at a bank previously and was generally better with money than I was. Or so I thought. I learned just before our divorce that she was robbing Peter to pay Paul so she could pay bills and she spent the remainder frivolously.

Fast forward several years until I meet a level-headed woman and got married again. Since my credit was in shambles and I owed child support we tied the knot with the understanding that our finances would be separate. Now, my child support is over. I've educated myself about finances, and eliminated all debt. I've begun building a nice net worth with eyes on an early retirement. Our finances are **still** separate and we couldn't be happier.

"Thank you for your response.

I don't think I'd like Dark Souls because I'm just not into medieval styles of games, except Zelda if it counts.  Bayonetta does look like fun and I've thought about buying Bayonetta 2.  Is Bayonetta a kind of game that I could leave sitting for a week or two and then pick back up and get into it fairly quickly?  Also I did buy Xenoblade Chronicles X but haven't started playing it.

&gt;There are currently 450,000 warrants stemming from the region’s 52,000 municipal ordinances.

&gt;“Warrants are so prolific that 27 municipalities in St. Louis County have accrued more outstanding warrants than they have residents,” he said. “This disproportionately impacts municipalities with large populations of African-Americans

It was a basic class and there were a lot of different levels of experience, since some kids went to public high schools with basic art education, and others were a bit more advanced since they went to art-based high schools and programs.

There was this one kid who was the latter, and just was really unnecessarily mean, rude, and unhelpful to the kids he deemed weren't good artists. It finally got to a point where during a critique where he was being rude, I said in a neutral tone ""Why are you always so rude?  all here to improve.""

This increases the amount of blood and allows a natural sequence to occur — an erection in response to sexual stimulation. These medications don’t automatically produce an erection. Instead they allow an erection to occur after physical and psychological stimulation.

I was a good little 'pansexual' libfem. I was open to dating transpeople. I identified as genderqueer myself for years. And holy fuck, it's a steaming pot of crazy. My FtT ""boyfriend"" couldn't take it when I complimented her, even in a masculine way... so I learned not to give complements.

Since then, I started dating a woman.... an actual one. And while we might have differences, I don't have to wonder what word to call one of her body parts or even second-guess myself for saying something benign. Remember that most people AREN'T trans. Your chances are pretty good, I think:)

Turns out I found them at just the right time. 2011 was the year that my best friend died suddenly from heart failure. No prior symptoms, a total shock to everyone. I was in a really dark place for like 6 months. One of the things that helped me through it, aside from great support from family and friends, was listening to the HP audiobooks on my drive to and from work. It was pure escapism, and I also found myself identifying with Harry - grieving the loss of friends and family, asking tough questions about life, facing fear, and ultimately choosing to live your life anyway.

". “CBD is most effective without THC.” THC and CBD are the power couple of cannabis compounds—they work best together. Scientific studies have established that CBD and THC interact synergistically to enhance each other’s therapeutic effects. British researchers have shown thatCBD potentiates THC’s anti-inflammatory properties in an animal model of colitis. Scientists at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco determined that a combination of CBD and THC has a more potent anti-tumoral effect than either compound alone when tested on brain cancerand breast cancer cell lines. And extensive clinical research has demonstrated that CBD combined with THC is more beneficial for neuropathic pain than either compound as a single molecule.

The reason is because most of the support materials you can draw from in the game is through monsters, hazards and the like. There's pages upon pages of groups like the Aeon Priests and the Jagged Dream, but groups often require larger cities and better social abilities for it to work for players. The number of foci and abilities that affect other characters is small to the amount of foci and abilities that help in combat or avoiding environmental hazards.

Numenera is hard SFF, so you can look towards Planescape, Dr. Who and Rick and Morty for ideas on cool philosophical or existential threats that an organization can represent.

1. Jarge seems a little uncomfortable/out of place (at least in the TSM legend videos) whenever the team is talking about anything besides league.

I like the idea of focusing on the things learned through a loss, but I heard someone say something like ""Nobody cares what happens this early in the season"", and that sort of just rubbed me the wrong way. There isn't a preseason in the LCS. Every game counts for something.

3. This video kinda reminded me that I feel like Bjerg and Doublelift need to make sure Sven and Hauntzer never feel like 2nd class citizens on this team. I think that could happen pretty easily since Bjerg and Double were stars on their past teams and seem to have a lot of chemistry already.

""Taming

Mesopithecus is tamed non-violently, rather than through the usual methods. Put the food you wish to feed it with in the far-right slot of your hotbar. Then, approach Mesopithecus and press the use key (default:E) to feed it when the button prompt appears. Do not get any closer than necessary for the prompt to appear, or Mesopithecus will get scared and run away. If it runs, try to keep it in sight - they can get fairly far away and their small size makes them easy to lose—but avoid chasing after it or it will continue to run. Be mindful of its health bar whilst taming, everytime the Mesopithecus becomes startled it will lose a small fraction of its health, scare it too many times and it will die.

Wait about 15 seconds between feedings, and try to approach it from behind or when it is stopped to reduce the risk of accidentally walking into it. Crouching and going prone slow your movement speed, making it easier to control your approach and avoid accidentally getting too close.""

Another one of my favorite passages, that you might recognize from [Futurama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edCqF_NtpOQ),


""When the Master governs, the people

are hardly aware that he exists.

Next best is a leader who is loved.

Next, one who is feared.

The worst is one who is despised.

If you don't trust the people,

you make them untrustworthy.

The Master doesn't talk, he acts.

When his work is done,

the people say, ""Amazing:

"Tegen.

Ik steek zelf niet af maar ben voor het vrije afsteken als nu gebeurt. Tegen 21% BTW is het een zeer lucratieve inkomstenbron voor de overheid. Als het naar de gemeenten verschuift valt deze inkomstenbron voor het rijk weg en zal op een andere manier geint worden. Bovendien zou ik dan middels mijn gemeentelijke belastingen voor iets betalen waar ik zelf weinig plezier uit haal.

Natuurlijk sneuvelt er het een en ander aan materiaal met Oud en Nieuw maar daar betalen we de verzekeringen voor. Noem mij een cynisch maar ik geloof niet dat mijn verzekeringspremie om laag zal gaan wanneer deze kostenpost wegvalt.

I bought the mini van that she was driving and let her keep it after we split and of course (sigh) the mobile home.   Agreement was that if she would sell it I would get half, (it was in her name because I was building credit at the time, but paid for the bills).   Well, she sold it cheap to be able to unload it before we could get legal on it with lawyers.   Once I found out, I told her to return the van or I'll report it stolen.   She begged for me not to do that because how else will she get around.  She didn't want to buy the van off me for half what she sold the trailer for.

"I hated what he did with the dementors, and moreso what he did with Expecto Patronum. When this movie released, the third book was my favorite, and I thought the movie missed nearly every mark of my imagination. Everything from The Knights Bus to the poorly handled backstory of the Marauders. Another butched opportunity for backstory was in the 6th movie, but lets not go there.

One may say Cuaron certainly made the movie more unique than the previous ones, but personally I disliked so many of his artistic choices. The main reason they work, I think, is because The Prisoner of Azkaban is kind of a weird book, that fits these choices better than any other book would. Like he mentioned in the video, its in the transition phase from childhood to teenage years. But also, this is the only (!) book that actually deviates quite heavily from the main plotline of the series.

"#Explanation of why parenthesis "" "" is needed for those ID starting with 0

The compilation of UOCs is most likely (like, 100% guaranteed) to be done on a spreadsheet like MS Excel. However, MS Excel has the annoying peculiarity of auto-truncating away any starting '0' in numbers entered, unless it is entered as a 'text format' by having quotation marks, or with a ' preceding it (e.g. '0xxxx). If you messed up and did not enter with quotation marks, my condolences...

Although, Gumi staff could pre-define the cell formats to text type instead to avoid the truncating in the first place... dunno why they did not do it..

edit: Excel also in a way restrict digit length... digits longer than 11 are auto-truncated into exponents (e.g. 4.17247E+11)... this might be another factor in messing up some players' UOC

STAMFORD - A proposed merger between the two largest beer-makers in the world has craft brewers watching closely.
Conor Horrigan, founder of Half Full Brewery in Stamford, says the merger between Anheuser Busch InBev and SABMiller could lead to fewer choices for beer drinkers.
""The consumer may want our beer, but they're not going to get it because the retailer has their offerings to give and those offerings are being influenced by these bigger players,"" he says.

Horrigan says in addition to the proposed merger, there are a few other developments in the industry.
He says large breweries are offering a lot of incentives to retailers, creating a ""pay-to-play"" atmosphere.
Large brewers are also buying craft breweries to expand their offerings.

A couple of things to check first.

* Backup your wallet.dat
* Backup your reddcoin.conf
* What version of wallet is installed? it should be 1.4.1.0
* Are you on Windows/Linux/OSx??

Assuming windows, clean up data folder

* delete everything in your C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Reddcoin **except** for reddcoin.conf and wallet.dat
* With wallet.dat and reddcoin.conf the only files in your data directory,
* And if you decided to bootstrap (https://wiki.reddcoin.com/index.php?title=Bootstrap_the_Reddcoin_Blockchain)
* Start the Reddcoin wallet

"&gt;L.A.'s Open Women's Division -- so-named because unlike the more populated men's leagues, it isn't divided by skill or location -- plays on Tuesday nights. In the Pistol Shrimps' first season, the spring of 2014, they compiled a **3-9 record** at the Lake Street Community Center, with two of those victories forged against the winless Lucille Ballers. The Shrimps' losses were frequently double-digit affairs, due in large part to their lack of experience.

&gt;With just a few months off between seasons, the women returned for the fall schedule in September and compiled **another 3-9 record, including a playoff appearance**. Their celebrity status grew along with their game, thanks in large part to Plaza's involvement and frequent posts about the team on its Twitter and Instagram accounts.

We all view the opposite gender as sexual objects, even when we aren't aware of it. Few people marry someone they don't like unless there are external/societal pressures to do so, there's a biologically rooted reason for this, and it has to do with attraction. 

And ""stable relationship"" includes viewing the other partner as a ""sex object,"" from time to time-- it's a healthy part of any relationship, contrary to whatever you're taught abut being the emotional tampon in a relationship.

The majority of deaths occurred during wars started by the Arabs/Palestinians, such as the First Lebanon War (20,825), the Yom Kippur war (19,000) and the War of Independence (10,000).  
  
As can be seen from the aforementioned, it cannot be said that Israel is genocidal in its treatment of palestinians, as most of the deaths and casualties occurred through war and not systematic slaughter.",1100.0

"I'm really sorry to hear your experience is so similar to mine.

I had a motherboard failure on a 2nd gen x1 carbon. I first called their service center, who told me to send in the laptop. Then, I waited for about 20 days, before service center asked for 500 dollars (plus tax) to replace my screen (which was perfectly functional) because there was a crack on the top right bezel. I didn't want to do so and they escalated my case. One week later, they decided they still wanted to replace my screen at cost and was not willing to replace the motherboard (covered by warranty) unless I paid for the screen. Feeling that I didn't really have a choice, I gave them permission to go ahead with the screen replacement. The parts were delayed and the entire process took 2 months. 

By then, I had already received my XPS 13 from Dell, since I had no backup computer. I ended up selling my X1 on the internet for 700 dollars. ",1100.0

"Take the time to learn all the HOTKEYS for drawing cards and manipulating decks of cards. Most of these tricks are not explained in the tutorial so look them up on a wiki.

You'll save a ridiculous amount of time. The eldritch horror mod for table top is pretty solid, although it is not updated for all the latest expansions as of yet. Remember you can adjust and customize everything. Once you make a save file of your preferred set up you can easily load the game and start playing.  

When you need to draw a random spell, or random creature, I suggest just shuffle the deck, whatever comes up is your randomly selected item. This way, you don't get freezes when you pull a highly detailed token out of a bag. (The monster bag is the issue I had)

"&gt;  If your console is near your router, it's possible that's what is causing the interference.

As yes, forgot to expand on this in my first post mate. Although you say the iOS devices are all using your 2.4GHz network, is there anything else close to the xbox one like your router which is also broadcasting out your 5GHz band or any other of the 5Ghz wifi devices like computers (HTPC or similar on 5Ghz wifi by TV?)? This could be causing interference issues.

"My first response to the question was what? No! 

But as I read through the responses, I realized it's more of a case by case basis. I skim and skip, depending on previous poetry in the work and how bearable it is/relevant to the plot.

Tolkien, I skip. Rothfuss, I read. Martin, I skim (some songs don't seem particularly plot relevant, but then you get the Rains of Castamere ....).

When I was a kid, I remember *loving* the poetry bits from the Dark is Rising series. Like, they hooked me and brought me back to the books. I would find myself repeating the lines at random times. I still do. On the other hand, the poetry bits from Redwall et al were so boring that it took mentions in this thread to remind me they existed. So ... basically, if the author shows the poetry/song bits serve a valid purpose not reiterated elsewhere in the text pretty early on, I read em. Otherwise, I ignore em. Case by case.",1100.0

And then on top of the fact that it's hard to find anyone with the 3 specific totally unrelated/different skills they want, a lot of us who *do* happen to be able to fill roles like those would really rather just be doing one job instead of 3-- so that makes it even harder for companies with this mindset to hire. As someone who is currently in a job where I was hired with that exact kind of reasoning, I can't wait to leave and get back to a company where I can do one job for one money (or three jobs for three money would work too, I guess). Once I leave, I think my company will be hard-pressed to find just one person to fill my exact role. I don't think this situation is uncommon at all, and I think it really explains a lot of situations in which a company fails to be able to fill a senior-level role.",1100.0

"&gt;As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore. A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him, even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents and pictures. ...he will refuse to believe it.... That's the tragedy of the situation of demoralization. 

&gt;Even if I take him, by force, he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom. When the military boot crashes his, then he will understand. But not before that. That is the tragedy of this situation of demoralization.

"Serious response and I hope this isn't too late to fall to the bottom of the barrel because it will affect the cost of college. Get that money out of the kids name by the time they go to college because money in children's names adversely affects financial aid (grant and loan) money significantly. The rate at which money in children's names is penalized at 20% or 25% depending on whether you use the FAFSA or CSS Profile. For example: if your child had $10,000 in their name and your Expected Family Contribution towards college was $20,000 based on your finances then $2,000 = ($10,000*.2) would be added to the EFC making your new EFC $22,000. The would drastically inhibit aid the more and more money goes into their names. If the money is intended for college anyway a 529 may be a good option.

"&gt; Strong positive correlation between Republicans taking control of Congress and this stabilization. 

Stabilization began before Republicans took control, and progress on recovery flattened once the stimulus funds ran out and austerity from the sequestration kicked in. We didn't fall into a double dip recession, but neither did the recovery perform as well as it should have.

&gt; Otherwise, what specifically did Obama do to bring about income growth and lower unemployment? Especially since Republicans get the credit for 'obstructing' his every move?

It's a shame you didn't read the article. Krugman explicitly addresses this:

&gt;&gt; And meanwhile we’ve seen a dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured Americans, so while income has been flat, income security is up substantially.

He also concludes with a prediction that you've fulfilled:

"Once you reach a certain level of skill you can say the word for one spell whilst actually channeling another. It's not really about the name of the spell but rather an understanding of what you are trying to do.  

Remember how often the grown ups cast spells back and forth in duels without actually saying anything. Non verbal spells are taught at Hogwarts from the sixth year and onwards.  

In other words, the debate about how to pronounce the name of a spell is unnecessary. They are kids being taught magic at this point in the books though, you've gotta start somewhere.",1262.80806

I'd like to preface this by saying I'm on mobile, so forgive my formatting and potential mistakes throughout this wall of text. 

This is actually a very interesting science behind what's going on in this picture. As frogs/toads mature, they begin to develop an enzyme absorbing layer of skin on their stomachs. Usually they make use of this by sitting on nutrient covered lily pads for a good while. We believe they adapted this layer from the scarcity of insects in well populated habitats, so it offers an alternative to needing to survive off of small bugs. 

My guess would be that this is what the frog in the picture is doing. He has mounted the fish in order to feed off of whatever water produced nutrients are on his fish friends back. It's almost as if the frog is becoming more parasitic which is very interesting. What's even more interesting is that I actually have no idea what I'm talking about and this is totally a frog boning a fish.",1100.0

"Posted wrong place first time.

First post here but I've been looking for a good balisong. The Dog Bite Kit from USAKnifeMaker looks like one of the better kits out there now but I can't find any reviews on them if they're worth the price. I like that it has Ti scales right out of the box and that the blade comes dull, which is good for me as a beginner and since it wouldn't be an EDC knife. I am accustom to projects so assembly and finishing it will be considered fun.

My other option is that I can get a BM62 for about $20 more but they are heavy and I'd want to get some Ti scales for it later. I've learned from my friend's BM 62 that with the combination of its weight and BM sharp edge, it's easy to get deep cuts.

Really, I'm just looking for anyone who has heard anything about these Dog Bite kits, good, bad, or decent.  Or if the BM62 is the way to go.

Thank you.

"I just switched from the Nexus 6 to the Nexus 5X about a week ago. The main reason being that the Nexus 6 was just so uncomfortable to use with the size of the screen.

Things I've noticed of the Nexus 5X:

1. The screen is a much more manageable size and comfortable to use, and I haven't had any problems reading text, viewing pictures, typing, etc., on it.

2. Even with less RAM, this phone is still just as quick, if not quicker, out of the box than my Nexus 6 was with the CPU governed on performance.

3. The battery life and charging have been very good. I got almost 24 straight hours out of it while using it to send texts, make phone calls, played light games, and streamed music to Bluetooth headphones. And if you thought the quick charge on the Nexus 6 was fast, you will be blown away with it on the Nexus 5X.

"I've been following this since you posted, and my advice is this: words are clumsy, words are awkward....words will ruin the incredible excitement going on here.

In order to proceed, do so wordlessly....once it has occurred there'll be all the time in the world to talk about it.

Everything you did was great, until you spoke. Next time, do everything the same as before, except: when you have his hand on your bare breast, fondling it, you put YOUR hand over his and squeeze and stroke your breast as you mnormally would while touching yourself.....wordlessly communicating all that is necessary for the two of you to proceed further. Also, try push your bum back against his cock....in the spooning position this is great, it's subtle yet to-the-point, move your hips ever so slightly back and forth in a gentle, slow, back and forth motion.

When he finished, he refused to take questions because he didn't have time to cover the material if he did that. So, I went to his office during office hours. The first three times he wasn't there. When I finally caught him and asked him to review the material, he said that he already taught that in the class and that he didn't want to repeat himself.

The week before the final, my average was 30. I've never had an average that low, and I wasn't alone. I dropped the class and signed up again. It was like a reunion of the first class with half the class full of students from the previous semester. Unfortunately, he's the only professor for diffyQ.

I like keto a lot because it feels more sustainable than other diets I've tried (cutting out carbs = reduced cravings, more fat/protein = more satiety, normal diet ""no-no's"" like bacon or cheesecake aren't banned at all, not to mention all the added non-weight related health benefits), so that makes it easier for me to not regress into my old ways / keep up healthy habits &amp; weight loss.

    while(i &lt;= n) {

This will always be O(n).

    j = n;
    while(j &gt;= 1) {

This will also always be O(n).

    for (k = 1; k &lt;= j; k++) {

This is n, then n-1, then n-2, then ..., then 1. On average, this is n/2, which is O(n).

Therefore, the overall algorithm is O(n * n * n) or O(n^3). I don't know if that is correct, just my educated guess.

you can also get a hurricane v1.2 clone.in silver it has stainless steel tank.its also not very big atomizer.easy to coil and wick (basicly a better taifun).there is no top fill or juice flow control.


these two are mtl (serpent can give you a little restricted lung hit) single coil tanks.

i can advise kf4 but i didnt really have any luck with the clones and even with the original its really fiddly.

all these said atty is not really the culprit most cases.its the mod.

"Actually, Apple doesn't apply an ""Australia Tax"" to their products. Take an Apple product that's sold on the US Store, such as the base model MacBook (the 12 inch retina one), which goes for USD$1299. This figure does not include sales tax, because this is variable from US state to US state. The exchange rate is currently 1 USD = 1.4199 AUD (or thereabouts). So that works out to be AUD$1845 (with some rounding). Add 10% GST (because the prices in Australia on taxable items has to include the GST), and we get AUD$2030.  Now let's look at how much the exact same product is on the Australian Apple Store. It's currently $1999. Which means Apple actually gets less from us at the moment than they do from their US customers (probably because I don't believe they've update their prices anywhere since the iPhone 6S was released).",1296.813488

"Sure thing! So when it comes to asteroids (I use the 3 biggest ones) I always try to force them on my opponent's side so that their initial approach will be skewed at some point. For example: I tend to put asteroids in their corner at range 3 from the edge, not 2. That way I can put another one close to the edge at range 2 near the middle of the board. It creates a weird angle to turn in from, and it's opposite what most people do (asteroid range 2 in the corner, then clustered in the middle). 

As far as decloak paths... I didn't intentionally set anything up, mostly because my decloaks were super clunky (probably because I'm not a veteran Phantom player) and I didn't plan them in advance much until a few games in when started to get the hang of it. I mostly decloaked forward and looped around asteroids, playing hard to get rather than attack from the side with decloaks. Probably gonna change my strategy- I barely used the Decloak-&gt;Hard 1 and that's probably the best maneuver the Phantom can do.

I know not everyone is a nudist (I only go recreationally about twice per year), but people really do make a way too big of deal over seeing a body.  The more we accept that everyone has slight differences but are mostly the same, that no one is really odd and no one has anything to be embarrassed about, the healthier society would be.

Might help, though you may have lasting effects if you've smoked a lot of Indica pot over the years.

The only real root that satisfies the equation is [k ~ 0.1461](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-6k+%2B+18k^%282%29+-+%286k%29^%283%29%2F3!+%2B+%286k%29^%284%29%2F4!++-+%286k%29^%285%29%2F5!%3D+-4k), which is pretty close.

"nociception is a vital sense.

The ability to experience pain is a necessary part of life.

These drugs allow people to feel okay after surgery, when a doctor cuts into your body and digs around with metal tools. These drugs were used by the East India Company to wage economic war and started the chinese Century of Humiliation.

It's nice because it mimics the ""shh, it's okay, calm down"" signal your nervous system makes automatically when shit acts up for no reason, or when you have more important shit to do than tend to injuries.

It burns out your natural sensitivity, and your body eventually gives up on making its own. When you stop doing opiates, your nerves can't help but report disaster.

that's why it's so effective at enslaving people.",1257.67322

You'd be shocked at how vague some of the rules in the book are, but then again when we look at them so closely so often there's always going to be questions.

But your boy doesn't come empty handed and the NBA has a case book for shit like this and it talks about it specifically.

&gt; Player A1 attempts a field goal that bounces off the basket ring and continues in
play. Either immediately before or as the ball hits the basket ring, Player B1 makes
contact with the net. Is this a goal tending violation?

&gt;No. The mere fact that Player B1 touches or pulls the net is not in itself
a goaltending violation. **The contact must be such that it is the primary
cause for the field goal attempt being missed. As an added clarification
to this ruling, the same applies to the slapping of the backboard.**

Other projects like [this one](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=30879) attempt to partially automate the process with some hand-drawn details, but it's very slow. Others attempt to redraw the sprites from scratch, which looks good but usually doesn't get very far.

"F, 52. Yes, I have 2 kids, both early teens. They took a LOT of energy, particularly the older one. 

But it was that fact - that having them taught me a lot about myself in terms of how to be a better person, role model, that made me realize I needed to take better care of myself, I needed to put my needs near the top of the list.

Even if you assume that 100% of wastewater comes from fracking wells, you need to understand that there is no way you or I could realistically convince the Oklahoma state government to relax its ban on fracking bans, so (in my opinion) it makes much more sense to target the issue of deep water injection first and foremost with the issue of frack fluid composition and/or other issues being secondary for consideration.

One of my scenarios went like this:
Setup:


Door separating us


I see the initial radar ping and back waiting ready to toss a made 



Door opens and I spot titan



I land a perfect sticky nade

 
Titans shield doesn't budge and he's charging

 
I backpedal and connect with incendiary knife to head...no burn as it doesn't register 


I'm Still backpedaling while connecting with MIDA and a few hits register


Titan is upon me, shotgun kills me and then poof...blinked/disappeared


The rest of the match my entire team complained of similar encounters.


He never lagged out, got DC'd thus remained in game entire match while continuing to bounce red and green on the connection bar.  Unfortunately I didn't capture the video. ",1239.91295

"&gt; Mutta palatakseni tuohon suihinottojuttuun - onko raiskaus raiskaus, jos uhri ei koe kärsivänsä mitenkään? 

Jos uhri on pakotettu seksiaktiin, eikä pysty ilmaisemaan myöntymystään tai estämään tilannetta halutessaan, on kyseessä raiskaus. Sen ei pitäisi olla riippuvaista siitä nauttiiko uhri tilanteesta sillä hetkellä. Onhan esim. raiskausfantasiat naisilla yllättävän yleisiä, mutta se ei koskaan tarkoita etteikö myöntymystä tarvittaisi. Kärsimys voi myös tulla jälkikäteen, mistä syystä on vieläkin tärkeämpää ettei tilanteessa ole epäselvyyksiä.

Voi olla, että miehet ajattelevat, että mies voi aina halutessaan estää raiskauksen fyysisen etulyöntiasemansa takia, mutta yleensä kuningas alkoholi ja harvemmin jäätyminen voivat eliminoida tämän edun täysin.",1100.0

"I suspect the warframes themselves have latent capacities for thought. I mean, they're biomechanical, and they probably have a CNS.

"I love this. Am going to do it today for shits and giggles.

Here's an approach that should be useful for anyone else out there. It's worked for me once.

Get a cheap burner phone and PAYG sim.  

Make a CV vaguely similar to my real one using a fake name but ideally suited for the role as it appears on Jobserve.  
 Dont just change the name. Rewrite it, change formatting and content etc.   

Contact the agent and do everything possible to get an interview arranged.  

You should now have either the hiring managers name or someone in HR.  

Fake you now pulls out of the interview. Say you've been offered a role that you're going to accept.  

Real you sends your real CV directly to Manager or HR.  

Real you interviews and gets the Job! and manages to negotiate a daily rate thats equal to what was being paid to the agent ie before they skim off their margin and give you the rest.

"The [Fit BF 1](https://www.danscomp.com/products-BIKES/102713/2016_Fit_BF_1_Bike_%28Brian_Foster%29.html) and [Subrosa Salvador XL](https://www.danscomp.com/products-BIKES/102620/2016_Subrosa_Salvador_XL_Bike.html) seem like good bets. Both are $400, have a 21"" TT, and are roughly the same spec-wise as each other as they are fully sealed and both have a bit more chromoly in the frame. I've always thought Fit made good completes so that'd be my pick personally.

If you could spare $20 more, the [Kink Whip](https://www.danscomp.com/products-BIKES/102580/2016_Kink_Whip_Bike.html) is $420 and in my opinion the best bike for the money you can get to start out with.

Also warding lane bushes is very important to get those stuns off. Add shrines along the lane so that if you find yourself in trouble you can pick it up for the health and movespeed in a pinch. As for his ult, I'll let you figure out how to do that, but if you can hit both enemy bot laners, it makes it super easy to get into position to land off your q stun on both with good timing. If you're against somebody with mobility try to hit them with the q first because even if they dash away they still get stunned from the second hit.

My least favourite team has to be the Calgary Flames. Proximity rules yknow.

My favourite player on the Flames is Josh Jooris. I love his story being undrafted and working his way up into the NHL. Right handed shot that plays a solid two-way game? You already got some small spot in my heart haha.

If I were a player, I'd be a RW PLY and have 90 skating, 85 shooting, 84 hands, 80 checking, 85 defense. The perfect fast skating passer with less than stellar hands. A Cogliano-lite if you will but I'm obviously better duh.

A player that I'd love to see in HUT would be Dwayne Roloson, He was my first ever favorite player and nothing beats the 2006 cup run for the Oilers.

A former overall pick, they still hold up really well and are now our budget choice, and were the favorite of every panelist in the $13 and under category. The RP-TCM125 have a nice overall balance with airy, mellow highs and present but not dominating bass. They sound just as good listening to acoustic guitar as they do hip hop and rock. Unlike most competition in this price range, nothing pierces, nothing muddies: every frequency plays well with the others. They don’t have the depth of field or bass quality of the AKG, but for $13, they’re still really great. The TCM-125 have a single-button remote and mic, and come in a variety of colors, too.

As Hostail said, we have several cases where members have randomly been Server Muted. This can be fixed with only a click by an admin or mod. Including me. Send me a PM and I'll check it out!

Due to lack of logging features in Discord, it is hard to find out who muted you, and it's also hard to find out if someone actually muted you and that it's not the client.

"My husband and I were monogamous and I was told by NUMEROUS doctors that I was totally 100% infertile. Well 3 months later we got a little surprise and that happy little surprise is now 5 and she has a 3 year old brother! When I was pregnant I almost completely quit smoking. I'd take a hit when my morning sickness was so severe that I couldn't even drink water. I feel like not smoking and therefore not drinking or eating was a lot more dangerous than a few tokes here and there. My pregnancies were honestly miserable. I gained 75 pounds with my first and 50 with my second. My second pregnancy started as a twin pregnancy and at 15 weeks we lost a twin so then I was considered high risk and had to undergo a lot more testing/ultrasounds/etc. I smoked here and there while breastfeeding and again, both kiddos are perfectly healthy normal kids with no health issues.

"I didnt read the article, but to respond to your point about wasted productivity:

There is a lot of flexibility in when the prayers are allowed.  You often have hours allocated to a specific prayer. As well, there are hadith that allow joining the prayers due to extenuating circumstances (such as not being able to break for prayer due to being a surgeon or what not..)

Prayer is a way of finding peace, and in fact it may actually result in more productive employees.  Taking a quick break for other reasons like smoking or a quick chat at the water cooler is perfectly acceptable during work hours, so I dont see why a 5minute break to pray is a big issue.

Throughout the movie I kept noticing what the camera was doing.

Let's tax the individual owner who is almost certainly in a higher tax bracket than everyone else there at his organization, along with all the owners and bosses out there.

I propose a maximum income tax, at, say half a million a year per individual.  Double the corporate tax.  Bust up large concentrations of wealth.  

And then it's ok that Bobby Smallfish in Hometown France wants to skim at 49 employees because the additional tax revenue will compensate individuals who need work with a basic income.

"&gt; In IR 2104, there is only One Input (for high/low) and In IR2110, there are two separate inputs, one input(for high) and one input(for low).

The 2104 is much more appropriate for what you're doing; it is designed for a situation where the transistors form a half-bridge, and it will never turn both of them on at the same time, as that would conduct current directly from the supply to ground.

The 2110 is designed for applications where it makes sense for both transistors to be on at the same time.  That is why it has two inputs.  At the *very* least you need to put an inverter (i.e. 1/6x 74xx04) in front of the LIN pin of the 2110 and connect HIN to the input and the inverter input to where you would have connected the input of the 2104.

However, even with that, you could have problems, since switching one transistor off and the other on with proper timing is important here and depends on many factors.",1100.0

Today is even worse, the 5th last mission I get a team 4+ levels higher than me with gear 2+ levels higher. If I try facing them with my B team I lose 3 before they even start.

"&gt; Asexuality is not a hormone imbalance.

&gt; Many asexuals have had their hormones tested and have been found them to be within normal levels.  Some asexuals have undergone hormone therapy for other conditions and have not reported any change in their sexual orientation.  In general, asexual people do not experience any of the other signs of a hormone imbalance (hair loss, erectile dysfunction, depression, hot flashes, etc.), so even when they haven’t been specifically tested, they can be reasonably sure that their hormones are in order.  Also, a loss of sexual interest due to a hormone imbalance is often sudden, while an asexual person typically has never experienced sexual attraction for their entire lives, so it’s not like anything was “lost”, because it was never there.

"I think quite a bit of racism these days is more classism.  I think a great deal of what people say about black people can equally be applied to poor whites, and its really only looking at the comment from the black/white perspective that it seems racist.  

For instance, my aunt is forever afraid of going to ""the city"", because the crime rate is insane there.  Similarly, she hates going to the west side of our town because the crime rate is horrible there.  On the west side of our town its 90% poor whites.  With her statement about fearing the city, she'd be considered racist by today's standards, when she is basically stating the exact same fear (of being a victim of a crime) in both cases.

"I started this process back in early November, but after waiting for the watch to take the slow boat from Russia, and then waiting again for Murphy to send me a new bezel, and Dagaz to send me an insert, I finally have my watch looking (more or less) how I want. 

The only thing I don't like about it is the band. The leather makes my wrist sweat and smell (and isn't waterproof), and a nylon NATO strap wasn't strong enough to keep the heavy watch from flipping around to the bottom of my wrist all the time. 

I'm thinking of trying out a Perlon strap, but I'm afraid that it may just give me the same problems as the NATO. 

A mesh bracelet looks nice, but I have skinny wrists and adjusting it seems intimidating. Also, I can't imagine something like that would be nice on the arm hairs. ",1243.84196

"Thanks for the reply and that's a really cool projects you did. Honestly currently I implemented something similar with a sort of DIY controller box with a arduino mega, l298 motor driver, display, buttons etc, load cell amplifiers etc. It was cheap ~$50 but it took me a lot more than a day to get it up and going ( it impressive that you're able to do that stuff fast but I'm not so skilled at such things :) ) 

So any way I have this one homebrew controller up and running but often times get hung up when on rewiring / reprogramming and tracking down weird issues for a new task. Also I need more units in general to run simultaneous tests. I was hoping to find a more standard solution. Cost wise it doesn't need to be super cheap, just not crazy expensive (like hundreds not thousands of dollers per set-up). 

I was hoping to hear from some lab techs. I dunno if their are any active subs for that sort of thing. Thanks again for the reply though.",1100.0

+ [Electrified (2014)] (https://youtu.be/y7Ulph8799I) Boris Blank won't stop... thank goodness!

 This band has been my favorite since they did 'Oh Yeah' in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and they have yet to disappoint me. I ask you: what other band has effectively used the sound of a snowball and the growling of a female white tiger in music, started sampling in 1979 (before most), and have kept evolving into a newer, more fresh and future sound? Boris is a master of layering music and will keep you coming back asking ""what new sounds has he found?"" And he always delivers. I have been spoiled!",1265.95366

- ~100 paintings to get my settlement size to yellow
- 28 turrets for 140 def and cover the entire settlement
- 3 Water pumps for 9 total water
- 1 power generator for 3 total power (not connected)
- 8 beds (one for me, one for the supply line person)

"How do you plan on extracting this energy? Cells store energy as oil (i.e., fat) for long term and sugar for short term. They convert the sugar to ATP, which isn't readily useable for anything we current have and a massive reworking of all of our technology is infeasible. Finally, how do you plan on getting this energy to the cells? With few exceptions, our solar power technology is far more efficient than biological energy conversion in turning solar energy into electrical energy. To convert biological (chemical) energy into useful electrical energy brings the efficiency much further down. In addition, if you want to store surplus solar/wind/hydro during period of peak production, you are going to have to convert electrical energy to light energy, lose tons of efficiency in the abovementioned processes AND lose a bunch of energy keeping these cells alive.

"Ja det skattas i väldigt många led.

Säg att en person tjänar 180kr brutto och har en marginalskatt på 30% (vilket är lågt i detta land). Då försvinner 55kr i skatt.(samt betalar företaget 56kr i arbetsgivaravgift.)
För de 125kr som finns kvar köper han en produkt, 25kr går till moms.
100kr i inkomst för företaget, som sedan kanske har en marginal på säg 10%.
Då har man en vinst på 10kr, som beskattas till 22% i bolagsskatt. De resterande 7.8kr kan delas ut till ägaren i form av kapitalinkomst som beskattas med 30%, dvs 2.3kr. 


Så på 180kr bruttolön hamnade 85.5kr (140kr inkl arbetsgivaravgift) i statskassan direkt i första omsättningen.


De 90kr som inte blev vinst betalas delvis ut som lön och beskattas genom samma process så där tar staten 54kr igen (om allt går till lön), osvosv.


I första steget är ju då skattetrycket nästan 60%, men det blir betydligt högre om vi följer pengarna längre.",1100.0

&gt;You can probably guess where this is going. Instead of focusing on either the closest or most distant part of your scene, you should focus on something in between. If you pick the right place in the middle to set the focus, the depth of field will extend forward to the log and back to the mountains, rendering your scene perfectly sharp. Consider this photo. Rather than focusing on the grass at my feet or the mountains in the background, I chose an intermediate spot, which allowed the entire scene to be sharply focused.

"From what I recall, to create a normal horcrux, the creator murders someone to fracture their soul, then the creator casts a spell to move the fractured segment of the soul into a container. 
Volde murders two people and then his body is destroyed when he tried to kill Harry. Since he cannot die (because of the other horcruxes) his fractured soul kinda flits around. One of the pieces breaks off and attaches itself to the only living thing around.

Dumbledore does explain in the books that Volde's soul was so mutilated at the time of the Potter murders that he couldn't/wouldn't have noticed the loss of the piece of soul.

It is possible (not sure if fannon or cannon here) that Volde was intending to make a horcrux that night, so he could have done some magic that forced the fractured soul bit to cleve away and attach to a nearby magical object.

THIS also may explain why, if you're a good player queuing solo, you're likely to get dumped into a match in progress with a lopsided score.

"&gt; with QoS enabled

Assuming the problem does not happen on internal calls, did you remember to rate limit your internet speed to 80% of its actual speed?  As the link nears saturation, jitter and packet loss increase, which kills VoIP performance.  By rate limiting your internet connection, you avoid this.  You sacrifice a little speed for low packet loss and jitter.

&gt; I believe we would benefit from switching our SIP provider to the ISP, am I correct?

It depends what is causing the problem.  It is very possible to achieve high quality VoIP over a good cable or DSL connection.

It's theoretically possible that Comcast is oversold in your area and the saturation problems are on Comcast's side.  Let's investigate your configuration first, as it is something we can correct if we find a problem.

Other theories: transcoding issue (use G.711u exclusively), PBX issue (try to connect a phone directly to Twilio).

FY2013 Submission
The Administration’s FY2013 budget submission initiated a new project for the design and
construction of a new polar icebreaker, and included $860 million over five years for the
procurement of the ship (Table 3)—enough or almost enough to fully fund the procurement of a
new polar icebreaker. (Any remaining needed funding might have been projected for FY2018 and
perhaps also FY2019, which were beyond the five-year window of the FY2013 budget
submission.) The submission stated that DHS anticipated awarding a construction contract for the
ship “within the next five years” (i.e., by FY2018) and taking delivery on the ship “within a
decade” (i.e., by 2023).38

"Alright, but since I sense the thought behind it, let me elaborate anyway. The reason I react to these games the way I do is because there hasn't really been a game that succeeded at the attempt. WarZ, downright scam. H1Z1, turned into a BR fest to the frustration of it's own playerbase that want the core game to get attention. Nether, is that game still being updated? Just so you know, I own all of these games and it's highly likely that Escape from Tarkov will also end up in my library as soon as it's available. Then I will experience the game and see what it's all about. 

The main reason I stated I probably wouldn't have played DayZ for 1300+ hours is because I like DayZ for it's open world, in which anything can happen. PvP zones don't appeal to me.

If you've got a good local museum or larger art gallery, see how much an annual pass is - when I was on my smallest budget ever during school, I still bought myself a pass to the art gallery so I could get out of my house, away from homework, and look at something beautiful. I was lucky that they changed exhibits quite often, too, so I'd stop in frequently for short visits to either check out my favourite paintings in the permanent exhibits or pop in to see the new stuff.

"&gt;●消費者や通報者の盾になって難しい問題をクリアしてくれるような組織があったほうがいいと思うが、そのような組織が日本でできないのはなぜか？  
消費者庁ができる段階で、法案の付帯決議で、公益通報の窓口の一元化ということで、消費者庁が一元的に窓口をしていくということになっていたんですけれども、なかなかそこが、やはり権限が難しいところでありまして、各違法の法律の所管はそれぞれ別の官庁だったりしますので、そこに対して調査の権限を出すのは難しいということで、なかなか法制度上、難しいのではないかなと思っています。  
●今まさに困っている人がいる、ということにどう対処していけばいいのか？  
まずは、やはり、そういった方々に対する支援というところで、例えば労働組合とか、消費者団体などがバックアップをするような、そういったような団体が必要になってきますし、イギリスの場合、そういったＮＰＯ団体がありまして、そこで支援をしていってたりしておりますので、そういったようなモデルを参考にしていく事が１つかなと思っています。

1) I stayed at the initial 20.4V but entered +20%, so I assume the voltage will then be 24.8V. At this voltage (6m/min wire speed) I could see blobs falling off the tip into the weld pool and assumed wire speed was too slow.

Instead of relying on magnetic fields on a metal disk, they relied on transistor arrangements that could remember their state without constant power.  That's what thumb drives and SSDs are.  They're also much faster than magnetic drives because there's no moving parts.

Watching television while eating can help distract you from nausea.

It is easier if you don't start with your food, sip at some tea or ginger ale  for a bit first.

Plain foods are the easiest, both to cook and stomach.  If all you can manage is a slice of bread while lying on the floor, than that is totally fine.  Baby steps.

You then mail copies to modeling agencies. If they like you they pay for everything,  and you pay them back out of the work they get you.

"Hi,

thanks for your offer, the wiki page is the best info i could get:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperDraco

Best suited for a quick fix would be possible the 2kn generic thruster with the 2 bells, but then you would have to double the power (in real live 2 motors are combined in one package)
I'm guessing your creating a ModuleManager patch, so the rescale and exhaust I could fiddle with by myself.

Fuel would be MMH/NTO with an estimated consumption of 62kg/s for a package of 2 motors at max thrust of 146kN for the 2in1 package.
Because they double as launch abort system max thrust has to generate 7-8Gs at max-Q so i speculate at a min trottle of ~10-15% (spacex just stated it would be very deep throttleable but haven't specified that any further yet)
I don't know if the 240s Isp could be maintained at these low thrust rates.

Would you be ok with sharing this engine with the comunity after i have scaled the size and exhaust?

Greetings

Los Boricuas were hired by DX to go after Stone Cold after he stole the title belt from Shawn Michaels. They chased him around backstage for a few segments on an episode of RAW before that PPV. They also have recent beef with Owen Hart since DX hired them to beat up Owen and drag him to them by the stage entrance on another RAW episode building to that show.

If it was less than 72 hours ago and you were exposed to his blood, genital secretions, or other potentially infectious body fluids, then you go to Emergency/A&amp;E and request PEP--Post-Exposure Prophylaxis.  They will determine whether whatever exposure you had represents a substantial risk for HIV infection, and if it does, they will prescribe a one-month course of antiretrovirals which *may* prevent you acquiring HIV, if indeed you have been exposed.

If it was longer than 72 hours ago PEP is usually considered no longer effective, so you wait a few more days and then go for an early HIV test, and then return for a second test and a full STI screening.

Also, you stop having unprotected sex with strangers.

Reason I think they are is choke points, Shores of Time if you get C spawn allows you to sit back and hold your zones but give A side no choice but to have to push via small choke points. This allows people to camp in the back of there spawn while holding zones. Now if you were to play Shores 3v3 without zones this changes completely. ",1100.0

"She's Great,  I run mine  Revenge x2 + blade.  (partly because in 10 months of d10 i've never seen a CD violent rune, and partly cause it works great with her 25% counter rate from passive)  It's not too uncommon for her to get attacked, counter with 1st and 2nd and do 20-30k dmg back and kill whoever hit her.

What's great is it's a 2 kick move, so the first kick can remove invincible/endure/whatever and the 2nd one can push through dmg.  (12-14k a kick if buff/def broken).

Also use her in dragon for fun, helps to remove immunity so bella can keep def buff up more reliably.

"Can we all come to our senses and agree its better to have entire towns/communities emigrate into a country all at once instead of having this kind of open door wild west where only the most desperate and adventurous young men are forced to risk everything just to be stranded once they get there?

As an American who knows a little bit about his ancestry.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but  many parts of the American midwest were populated by Europeans, who would often travel in families (late 19th, early 20th century).  There would be a little village somewhere in Europe and sometimes half the town would just be picked up and travel all at once.  Like transplanting a bush. It's important because once they arrive at their final destination they would have an entire clan/village to live with for support.

I think KSE are about to learn a harsh lesson in the cost of neglecting a franchise in an increasingly dynamic and competitive marketplace or league. Monetarily and PR wise.  If they have any intention of competing again (financially or on the field) they will now be paying over market rates for decent talent on and off field. Its pretty clear no one will choose to sign for the proven loser when all things are equal. ,1100.0

Om noget vil borgerlønnen gøre det billigere, fordi vi vil undgå den enorme administration det er at integrere flygtninge i velfærdssystemet.

"I haven't seen VR in 3D.

But, from everyone that I've spoken to who has produced it / viewed it, I have gathered a couple interesting facts. 
First, it's MONSTROUSLY more expensive to film and requires extremely complex software to produce (this includes the processing power and time to complete the images).

Second, it makes people much more sick because it's just not tweaked yet.

From my personal experiences, this view inside the headset is pretty convincing in ""putting you into the experience.""

Now, I'm not saying that 3D is not the next step forward; but, from what I've researched and heard, it is just at a point that is completely inaccessible to all but the largest production companies with the money and computing power necessary to produce.

For example, you have heavyweights in ROH doing high flying moves in and out of the ring taht are awesome and great to see. Then in WWE aside from Neville they do what, the ""crash and burn""? 

WWE is the same boring product with the same boring moves and the wrestling is predictable and never changes.

The album ""Clarence Greenwood Recordings"" is a classic but you might go for his newer stuff, songs like ""Keep Askin',"" ""Healing Hands,"" ""One Lovely Day"" or ""107°."" 

I'd be curious to know what you think if you check them out  or if you've heard them before. Happy listening : )

"Stibor always had a series of sayings he'd tell to people needing wisdom.

1) If you punch a person hard enough, they'll leave you alone.

2) Rational people tend to like money.

3) God has a way of making you feel like shit when he decides to do so.

4) Most people tend to ask others to think for them. Hence why I'm giving these out.

5) Money gets you your way only if you can use it to make people genuinely love you. Hence why the Church is so rich.

Burfict knew they had the game in the bag yet he still hit Brown even when he could have avoided the contact. Then Jones couldn't keep his mouth shut and got another penalty. After that, Jones went and posted a video of himself cussing out the refs and saying they they made bad calls. Totally immature and not the correct representation of a good football team. I'm a Steelers fan, so I'm not complaining about the penalties, plus I think they were the right calls and it makes it easier to hate Burfict and Jones, but don't blame the loss on Hill.

"This is so general and a blanket rule will not work in every circumstance. For example. If someone compliments you on something you have influence over (e.g. your fashion, your work etc) then you thank them, tell them what you did to obtain that results and then compliment them back on something related and that they also have influence over and ask them how they achieved their results. This builds a decent rapport and keeps the conversation going.

If someone compliments you over something you have no control over (e.g. your eyes) then you do not thank them. You had no input in what colour your eyes were, so really, you have no justification for excepting praise.

"Mind-muscle connection is less important than we make it sound. As the weight approaches about &gt;80% 1RM (can't remember the exact number to be), we are unable to actively contract the muscles involved via external cues. The body will recruit whatever is necessary to create the movement. Telling yourself to squeeze it just doesn't make the body recruit more muscles. 

You're slowing down the movement, forcing the muscle to work over a longer period of time in the single rep. Of course it'll make it harder.  

Half rep = half gains. Lesser work done, lower volume.  The best indicator for growth is still volume. ",1286.55957

The KMT under Ma was anti-status quo, in the sense that they wanted to build closer ties to mainland China, and seemed to be moving towards giving China greater (economic) control over Taiwan and eventually reunifying with China. Based on your comment, I think you would agree that Taiwan would lose the benefits of the status quo if that happened.

So we both agree that it is in Taiwan's interest not to allow itself to become part of mainland China insofar as that is possible? Sounds like you would be voting for Tsai Ing-wen, the status quo candidate.",1100.0

You say this is from an old table-based layout. When converting these you can replace the table elements with nested divs and use display:table or display:table-cell to duplicate the old layouts. All the benefits of using a table without having it in the HTML.

An alternative, if you are okay with cropping the images a bit, is to apply the image to the background of a cell and specify background-size: cover;.

"&gt; But over the long run probably not as costly as incandescent when you factor in increased lifetime and reduced energy consumption. 

I've read this is a massive marketing lie and that the amount you save in energy costs and replacement will rarely cover the cost of the bulb. At the home depot recently, the Incancecents were listed with claims of almost half the lifespan of CFL  bulbs. Also, the cost is minimal to replace. If it's a bulb you have on 24/7, you might get closer, but many many bulbs in people's houses are on for an hour at day or less, making the energy savings much less than the cost.

LEDs are still pretty expensive, especially ones that have ""smart"" features like that...

PS: Many many people will not own their home long enough to benefit from the long lifespan - It's a massive pain to take all your HUEs with you when you go, though for the cost of them, I would consider doing it -but then you have to replace all the bulbs in the house...",1100.0

Weight loss happens in the kitchen, not the gym.

Don't let yourself get discouraged.  Of *course* you're not going to molest your charges.  I'm sure you'll be a great teacher, too, but part of the job is not letting people get to you, and you're going to have to start now!

Incidentally, 93% of youth sex crimes are perpetrated by males, it's [true](http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV171.pdf), and from the same PDF, ""Juvenile sex offenders are also much more likely than adult sex offenders to target young children as their victims.""

"A GF diet and weight loss are directly linked IMO. Less carbs, processed foods, no beer, etc.. Most gf options are healthier than the alternative.

What are the odds that levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, have to play against levels 5, 6, 7, and 8?

Well, let's say 1 is assigned to a team first. 100% chance of that happening. Then we need to know the odds that 2, 3, and 4 are assigned to team 1's team. There are two approaches this could be done: 50/50 until one team is full, or each slot has an equal chance. If it's the 50/50 approach, then it's merely a 50% * 50% * 50% chance that all four are put together. So, 12.5%. If it's the each slot equal chance approach, it's 3/7 * 2/6 * 1/5 = 6/(35*6) = 1/35 chance.

"H-1B jobs are supposed to be filled when they can't find an american applicant.  However companies have all sorts of ways around it.

My personal issue is more with the culture differences.  About 90% of employees from India just don't think for themselves, you have to specifically tell them EXACTLY what to do.  They will start to work and then if they have to hesitate at all, they will completely stop what they are doing, and some times not even reach out to you for help, just sit there waiting for someone to check on them and correct them.

"&gt; not knowing exactly how much food you should buy with your ultra limited early wallet is important for the difficulty/thrill

That would not change with a hunger bar, especially if fights consume additional food as an anti-stall mechanic. You don't know how many fights you'll get into and how long they are going to be and you don't know how much backtracking you will need to do, so the element of unpredictability is still there. But with a proper hunger mechanic, it would be a lot more relevant to how you play the game; do you prolong a fight to heal up but spend valuable hunger points? Do you take the long route and hope not to run into too many combat encounters?

It increases the need for planning, it gives players several more important choices to make, it maintains unpredictability but makes it less sudden and more manageable by removing the completely arbitrary nature of the current system and it removes the need for the frankly quite obtuse and arbitrary anti-stall mechanics we have now.",1240.34814

I started maintenance at 149lbs. I've continued to slowly lose weight since then. It's definitely an odd experience. There are times when it truly feels like my body isn't any different than it was twenty or fifty or eighty pounds ago. And then I do things like take baths and it's just sort of undeniable that my body is much, much smaller than it used to be. 

I suppose I'm living out the cliche that maintenance is harder than losing -- I'm still not sure what my *actual* maintenance calories are. I was sick for a week and averaged around 2000-2500cal/day while barely moving and gained only water weight, one and a half pounds that vanished quickly. Similarly, I was eating close to 3000cal/day during Christmas and I *lost* weight.

"I spent a good portion of my life viewing emotions as a weakness, and pushing them back.  Eventually they would manifest themselves in much unhealthier ways though.  It's been much better for me to just allow myself to feel, grieve when I need to grieve, and move on to the next moment.  

Emotions are part of what make us human.  Denying them doesn't remove their existence, or the consequences in having them.  I think of it like emotions are a body of water.  You can shore up the dam, but eventually the waters will rise and leak out somewhere else, somewhere it shouldn't.  It's better to get it out, channel it, and let the flood waters drain.  What I don't do is take it to the source.  They don't give a fuck about you and they've proven that.  

So, for me?  Yeah it's therapeutic as hell.  We can't just logic our way out of this, I assure you.  I have tried that before, and failed miserably.

"RE: carriers - I would suggest waiting until after your baby is born and then seeing if other parents will let you look at and/or try on some different ones (probably the best way is to find a new parents' group or a babywearing group in your area).

You may not really know what features are most important to you until after you've gotten to know your baby and post-pregnancy body - I quickly figured out that I needed something that was quick and easy to get on and off, adjustable enough for my husband to wear, had a good quality infant insert, and would pack easily.

The pre-ynab debt credit cards are showing up as if I've spent the entire balance during the month, which throws off the outflows column.

I think you may be confused on what column means what. On a CC, and outflow is still money spent. It's money spend on the CC. So, a monthly payment to the CC would not show up as an outflow on the CC, but an inflow. The outflow would be on your checking account.

"Why are you adding hazelnut flavoring to your American wheat ale? That honestly sounds like it would detract from the beer and give you something less enjoyable to drink. Personally, I would reserve hazelnut for a more malt-focused beer with flavors that would be complemented by hazelnut (i.e. Brown ale, Porter, etc...)
  
By ""getting ready to do secondary fermentation,"" do you mean you're getting ready to transfer the beer to another fermentor? If so, I would advise against that as well. I would just keep the (preferably unflavored) wheat beer in the primary until it's time to bottle.  
  
If you really want to experiment with hazelnut flavor in an American wheat, transfer your beer from your primary fermentor into the bottling bucket. Then, bottle half of the American wheat as-is, and then add hazelnut flavoring to the other half. Add small amounts at a time until you have the flavor where you want it.",1245.33391

"People self medicate anxiety with food quite often.  Advertising is getting the food in the door 'drink coke to quench thirst / reward yourself / relax / whatever', then it's up to YOU to start building that habit.  Once you've built the habit of mindlessly drinking coke, your body starts associating 'stress' or 'thirst' and whatever other underlying state you're in with the 'need a coke'... because that's what you have been doing unintentionally.  So then when you 'try to quit' your body is like a baby &amp; it's blanket, ""wha, I feel sad, I know, a coke makes me feel better because it made me happy at some point!"".  Repeat.

"what's going to happen is the usa and allies will tell china behind the scenes: ""heel your rabid dog""

china will do nothing, paralyzed by the severity of the task

then, if war ever seems imminent, china will get its act together quickly and wake up when it realizes a nork attack on the south will be a losing proposition for them as well

then china will quickly precipitate regime change

the entire existence of north korea started with china, continues with china protecting it, and it will end when it finally dawns on china that this regime is a weight around its neck, not a benefit to attack the west and the west's allies

china needs to realize this sooner rather than later, things are not improving

TA, in addition to adding your Agility to weapon damage, would give ALL the threat generated by your attack to whoever you were standing directly behind.

"Sounds similar to Nehalem Rifts and Greater Rifts in Diablo 3. Which I think is the only viable conclusion for replay value in a game such as this. 

The thing with Diablo 3, with Marvel Future Fight, is that if you grind long enough you will have multiple characters capable of effortlessly clearing the hardest Story missions. 

Diablo 3 addresses this by adding even more uber gear and trinkets to the game and then giving players an unending ladder to climb. The focus of the game shifts from trying to clear 1 stage as quickly as possible to coming up with creative gear and skill combinations and see how high you can reach. 

Not sure what it will be exactly, or when we will receive it, but as I said earlier, it's the inevitable progression of the game. ",1100.0

"The reason behind my statement of it being a invalid argument is because it shouldn't take a punishment for someone to know matchfixing is wrong and shouldn't have been done. Matchfixing, besides cheating, is literally the sin of all sports. I understand the point you are trying to make, and the fact that one thought of ""throwing/matchfixing"" to this extent in CS at its current stage, but I feel like that as an adult, playing a game/sport for money and pride, that you should know better than to fix a game for your own personal gain. 

As for the punishment, I don't agree with the permanent ban, but it's not for me to decide. Maybe1 year, maybe 18 months. It's up to Valve and other leagues to decide the punishment, and I think that when that time is served, they should be unbanned. ",1239.67286

"I'd recommend looking into them again. Since there are a ton of configurations of LEDs (temperature, lumen output, angle of light, etc...), there's way more room to accidentally buy something you're not happy with, but if you do a bit of research, you can get some that look fantastic. 

As for price, it's come down quite a bit if you're replacing lights that you use a lot. For instance I got a four pack of dimmable LEDs for the recessed can lighting in my living room for around $35. The energy savings paid off the purchase in around 4 months, not bad at all. Many LEDs come with 1-3 year warranties also, so if you do get a dud that burns out, you're covered.

That older generation of CFLs is definitely terrible, but those have come a long way too, it's now a question of them going from bright enough to brighter over the course of the first minute they're on rather than the insanely dim to tolerable over ten minutes, it's crazy that they deemed those old ones market ready.",1100.0

So far I've learned about subtleties in social status, what big companies are nearby, the culture of said companies, the kinds of people that populate certain areas, how people behave, etc. Pax (and even friends/family) also enjoy learning about your experiences/encounters as a driver and can be really encouraging when it comes to pursuing your goals.

"You're absolutely right that Marines fall under the category of Soldiers.
However, It's drilled into our heads from day 1 that we are Marines, not Soldiers. 
This being because Army refers to their men and women as Soldiers. The Navy are Sailors/Seamen/Rates(Yeoman, Airman, Corpsman, etc.), Air Force are Airmen, and Marines are Marines. That's why Marines get offended. Essentially you're calling us something that we aren't because we do not belong to the Army. It's not just Marines who react this way, Airmen and Sailors do the same. It's just a technical correction really, but no one likes to be called something that they aren't. ",1100.0

I have been down the road of casual sex/hook ups and I am not interested in being that guy anymore. I don't want to give myself away to girls that haven't earned me. I have not met my future wife yet, but I am preparing myself for her now by becoming the best person that I can possibly be. When I meet her.. It's going to be on. The sex is going to be amazing, and I will be able to tell her that I made a decision to wait for her and become the best man for her that I could. How lucky she will be to have a guy like me.

"Yes it does increase DPS versus PGI Chain Fire... Which one is considered broken... I do not know...

However.. In case people don't know this

PSA: How to Chain Fire at higher DPS manually.

Only worked for Dual AC quirked mechs like the Wolverine 6R or Dragon 1N...

Two weapons groups...

1. One weapon group Chain Fire, the other normal group fire.

2. Hit the chain fire group button once....

3. Now just hold down the Group Fire button.

Now you get Chain Fire at Higher DPS than PGI Chain Fire !!

Example for the past when the Wolverine 6R was better.

I wanted to see them, but if I cant I reccomend CARIBOU and FOUR TET.

Caribou's a bit of a mixed bag, since every album he has has a different sound but:

* [Odessa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq_tDOFU5tY) His most popular
* [Back Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7j6DyVcHRM&amp;index=9&amp;list=PL4lEESSgxM_7_AtmGWlkrBI5_s1EpsI2f) Something off of his newest release (this and the album linked is most likely what he'll play if its not new music)
* [Melody Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7Oe1DN5VDA) One of my faves from his older stock

Four Tet is more softer but I got into him at the same time as Caribou and I love both of them

* [Plastic People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GT_ABdbqrg) Sounds like the entryway of a large white sciency building

"I don't understand this post. Chris Lively has a bottle and that's where this image was captured. Chris also has a Batch one Damon, for which Shaun himself has told me he gave it to Chris because he knew Chris would never sell it. ""It's in good hands"" yet you're here saying the bottle is worth 10 grand. 

For something to be worth a specific figure, it will have to have sold at that price / be worth that value to one person. Did Chris receive an offer for 10 grand and turn it down? That's the only way we'd know the value. 

What I know is that Chris isn't in the business of selling beer but he is in the business of boasting about how valuable his collection is. I wouldn't be surprised if the 10k figure was made up.

Hillary attacks him on healthcare, he provides a personally handwritten letter from her commending his good efforts in the ACA a couple days later (forgive me if my memory is not specific).

Now this guy is negotiating for more debates on HIS terms, the balls on that guy. But guess what, this dude is on fire, competent and without fail.

"&gt;Dreptul de a demonstra nonviolent împotriva legiferărilor homosexuale trebuie să rămînă neatins.

Much strawman.

&gt;De aceea, mult mai eficace ar fi pentru „comunitatea” homosexuală dacă şi-ar axa solicitările pe combaterea discriminării concrete, cotidiene (şicane la serviciu sau în alte părţi, insulte, refuzuri), cu menţionarea unor cazuri reale şi cu urmărirea sancţionării celor vinovaţi. Le-aş da deplină dreptate (şi milioane de români ar gîndi la fel), pentru că este o porcărie să defavorizezi un om pentru raţiuni care nu ţin de valoarea lui umană esenţială: inteligenţa sa, energia sa, cumsecădenia sa.

De ce nu ar trebui sa existe un cadru legal ca raposatul sa imi poata lasa mie casa si masina pentru care noi doi am muncit cot la cot, si nu sa vina rudele homofobe care m-au ignorat ani de zile sa puna mana pe ele, sau sa vina statul sa le confiste.

They could, but it's much more difficult and trackable if they hack hundreds/thousands of store databases to get the info, than it is to hack one/a few state agency databases.  Also, many gun stores and dealers only keep paper records of this stuff, and keep it all offline.

&gt; Ignoring the fact that no one has proposed that purchasing a tracking-enabled gun by mandated.

Someone in this thread mentioned New Jersey already has a law on it's books that once smart guns are released on the market, only smart guns can from then on be sold. I have not sourced that myself yet.

&gt; Anyways, if you are going to go down all these conspiracy theories.

LoD is almost as famous and wanted as it is from an installment of one of the most successful and innovative gaming series on this planet: Battlefield!

While everything besides the concept of shooting guns is different in both games, the population of the title Battlefield: Hardline is (on the same platform PC) only a little ahead of Skippy's innovative, breathtaking universe of Line of Defense! 

With a difference of literally only a handful of players standing between BF:H and LoD, Skippy has the chance, even with an Early Access title, to surpass one of the biggest companies on the market, namely Electronic Arts! Investors in LoD are very excited for the upcoming changes and look forward to make this game great again.

Codex Alera reminds me of Avatar: The Last Air bender but only in that there are forces of nature that are manipulated by the characters.

We repudiate unionism, that is, church‐fellowship with the adherents of false doctrine, as disobedience to God's command, as causing divisions in the Church (Rom. 16:17; 2 John 9, 10) and involving the constant danger of losing the Word of God entirely (2 Tim. 2:17‐21).",1100.0

"Vibrato should hide some pitch issues, I think. Before Auto-Tune they would sometimes put vocals through a harmonizer that would essentially create a vibrato effect to hide pitch problems.

You sing at the same time as the piano. The goal of the exercise is to 1. train you ear, as you'll be hearing these notes and intervals over and over and 2. train your vocal chords and breathing to be able to hit the notes.

So initially you might be off and slide into the note. But after doing it enough times, you should eventually be able to just ""know"" which note you're going to hit (via relative pitch) and you're muscle/vocal chord/breathing memory will know what you have to do to go up a third or fourth, etc.

The 6 low gun ownership states are listed as New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Hawaii, Massachussetts, and Rhode Island.  Basically, most of New England and Hawaii. 

The ""High Gun Ownership"" states are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wyoming.


The low gun states also have a lower male population (over 500,000 lower) and an older population as well (by around 750,000).  


Also, it seems that Connecticut and Massachussetts don't actually meet the requirements to be a ""low gun ownership"" state.

I don't personally agree with having to completely stop everything, just stop what you had a problem with. Again, this is just my personal experience though. I don't have any urge to try opiates again, because the whole experience was so painful, but I never had a problem with drinking and pot, and I still continue to enjoy them once in a while. It really just comes down to each individual person. Some people can't do anything without completely falling off the rails. I had a friend who was completely unable to stop himself.

&gt; If you watch Hayven's video on Alpha Tanaan, you will see that it was almost entirely different. It means that in the gap between the 6.0 and 6.2 patch, they effectively developed an entirely new zone. That means that they can easily make a brand new zone for a future patch in Legion.

This means that in the space between 6.0 and 6.2 they developed *one full zone*. Which means it's fairly doable for them to work on *one full zone* between Patch 7.0 and the Tal'Dranath patch.

They didn't work on Farahlon, because they were working on Tanaan. And after 6.2, they had to move all workforce to Legion. And that's why there was no Farahlon. All other zones are being worked on in Legion, so I don't see any problem with having another zone in the works for a future patch.

With your own content and SEO, find as many different ways of tagging for machinima within GTA. 

So right now, I can see that the term ""GTA 5 machinima"" has 393k results

The term ""grand theft auto 5 machinima"" has 364k results.

The term ""GTA V Machinima"" has  930k results (holy hell)


Now let's specify that down a little, ""gta 5 director mode machinima"" has 10k, which gives you a **much** better chance to be found, so you can tag that with the similar ""Grand Theft Auto 5 director mode machinima"" with 9k. You see where I'm going with this, right? This stops you from filling up on useless tags like ""Animation""

"[1] Some of the methods actual forensics teams can use can be found at http://www.forensic-medecine.inf... (forgive the site's vintage-Tripod aesthetic - the info's actually rather good). 

[2] Description of this method can be found at http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_.... I'll emphasize the article's assertion that ""full fingerprints are difficult to get from fabrics,"" even with this bleeding edge technique. You would be able to see an impression, but getting a forensics association (remember, there is no such thing as a ""match"") would be highly difficult. However, don't expect any forensics method requiring evaporated gold and zinc to be employed in your local jurisdiction. Unless you've got a lead on the Zodiac Killer or JFK's Second Shooter, I doubt this would be at investigators' disposal.

"On Big Brother Canada one guy basically slept until mid to late game. Woke up, made quiet moves, pretended he was kind of dumb and didn't really know what was going on as far as the game. The audience knew he was smarter than he was letting on, but the house didn't. At the end I don't think he had enough time to really explain his strategy and change people's impression of him to get the win. He was a likable guy, but people voting saw him as clueless in the game. He was up against another person people liked and was a vocal player. I think he may have been able to pull out the win against a less likable person, but then that's just trying to find a bigger goat (which there really wasn't). I guess what I'm saying is that it's hard to change people's perception of you in the short FTC (or final questions in BB's case) after 30+ days. ",1100.0
"Im not sure what your budget is or whether you are gaming on it, but [here](http://www.lappylist.com/laptops/best-programming-laptops/) is a website that I used to pick out my laptop for programming. For programming CPU speed is very important, however unless you are doing multi-threaded programming an i5 versus and i7 wont make a difference as long as they are similar models. This is because the only difference between i5 and i7 is the amount of cores. For RAM, 8gb should be enough, and PLEASE get an SSD, im assuming since the laptop is for work, most of the projects are stored on servers so you dont need a big clunky HDD, a small 256-500gb SSD should be plenty, if not a nice 128gb USB3.0 will work fine!

Editing has a huge impact on the narrative and controlling people's subconscious thoughts.  By the second episode, I believe SA has already earned the viewers sympathy.  There is a lot of emotional scenes with the Avery family, which is a sharp contrast to Mike Halbach.

"Coating a sword in metglass would results in a few things, good and bad.

First, the sword wouldn't need to be cared for quite as much. Since metallic glasses lack grains and grain boundaries, they won't corrode as fast. You wouldn't have to really worry about it rusting, for example.

You also wouldn't have to sharpen your sword, since the metallic glass won't deform like a regular sword would. This is kind of similar to those [ceramic knives](http://www.amazon.com/Shenzhen-Knives-Ceramic-Knife-Set/dp/B001976YQM) you can buy, although they're not quite the same (one is metallic glass, the other is just a very hard ceramic).

However, it wouldn't be perfect. Once you hit something hard, such as another sword, that other sword would crack right through your metglass coating. See, metallic glasses are resilient and have a high yield point, but they *will* fracture if hit hard enough. And then it would shatter like... glass.",1100.0

I'm a 5'5"", 23 year old woman. I've always struggled with my weight, but I joined a rugby team when I got to college and toned up a lot. When I started rugby, I weight about 236, and when I graduated, I weighed about 190.

At Aldi's the cashier has to make pretty much the same motion just so I can wheel over to the bagging area and then put the stuff into the bag myself.  No big deal, but I don't see how Aldi's is saving much money by not having the cashier drop items into the bag.

**Paul Baribeau** has an interesting minimalism. The lyrics, the song structures, etc. are all pretty straightforward. It's just typical my-life-is-terrible indie-folk. But because it's so simple, I can't help but enjoy it for that.

If he can't use magic directly on Vader to kill him because Vader would use the force to block it, he would manipulate the elements around them to hurt Vader instead, which would mean Vader wouldn't just have to dodge attacks directly from Voldemort, but objects coming at him from other angles as well, making it difficult to come close enough for a combat with the light saber.

As for API functionality - it would be fantastic for you guys to just add it (or just make it an optional install var); 

Unless i missed something there just needs to be add/delete/list functions with auth/domain/list'color' as vars. Im sure exposing a few API-based functions would allow more people to contribute nifty things.

Malphite is easier but Sion has more at his disposal.

No, its not but this is going to take time and support that you may not be prepared to give, as well as an internal drive that she may not have.  

Our ""pat"" answer to queries like this usually is that you can't make someone else lose weight.  There are no magic words.  The want has to come from her and it has to be enough to make a substantial start.  Otherwise, it's just, ""I know a person with too much fat, how can I make her want to lose weight?""  She probably already wants to lose (who doesn't?), but isn't prepared to start right now.

So when I do wide grip lat pulldowns I typically set the weight at 70lb.
However at the rec center it was a lil more interesting. 
I can usually reach the bar at 24. But at the rec center I could not (again im 4'10). I set the weight at 70, stood on the seat to reach the bar, and I ASSUMED the bar would come down, but nah man. I just dangled there. yep.

"You would have a fantastic time in Bristol as you would in London. Bristol is smaller and with better access to the countryside. It has enough going on to keep you interested. The University is a fantastic place (I work there) and the student scene is among the best in the country as most of the students live in a fairly small area near the centre of the city. 

London is vast which, for me, is a massive plus point. I lived there for 15 years and there are so many places I never got to visit. The student scene is arguably not as good as students are sort of based all over the place and it is more expensive than Bristol although Bristol is getting bad for both availability and price of rental properties. 

If I had to choose one to be a student in, I would choose London but honestly either would be fantastic. Bristol does have a lot of IT jobs so Uni in London and then career in Bristol would be pretty sweet...

She doesn't really want to give up her name because, like you, she sees it as a part of her identity and I really want her to be Mrs. ljtnonfire. We hashed out the reasons; for her, she sees it as part of her identity to the world and for me I see it as her fully becoming a part of my family and sharing a name that my kids will bear one day as well. We came to a mutually acceptable arrangement: when it comes to anything outside of our combined personal lives, such as IDs/passports, professional life, her friends, she is going to go by her given name, but whenever we are presenting ourselves as a combined family unit, such as with kids or with our families, she'll go by Mrs. ljtnonfire.

"I'm not arguing that it's rather worthless at low range, although a crit with it can easily kill even a battalions backup solly, and although if a solly is that close to you he probably rocket jumped and is at below 195 hp so a kukri would 1 hit crit too, 1 hit from an eyelander would also bring you down to below half hp, enabling you to 1 shot crit even a demo with 4+ heads and the booties.


But my point is sniper at melee range is probably going to be taking damage. Imagine getting headshot with the amby(or take a d-back crit), now you're gonna need THREE hits to kill the spy
while he needs 1 from just about any of his weapons.

Killer        DJ Sanji

Alvida      GPU

"It used to be 6 divisions and the top from each was guaranteed a spot which meant that 99% of the time it was top 8 in each conference.

&gt; Yes, it is shitty for Colorado, but the structure of divisions creates rivalries. If everyone in the west was just in one massive conference, regional rivalries become less meaningful.

Just playing a set of teams more often than others creates rivalries. Plus if you are fighting for a wild card spot you are going to have rivalries against the conference anyway. My thinking is that it should be the top 2 from each division and then 4 wild cards per conference. That way it's more likely that the teams with higher points make the playoffs but you still have the division rivalries in the playoff match-ups.",1100.0

"Most of us have been there at some point in time. For me, I know it was because of all of the teachings from Sunday school and church sermons about various sensational stories of how drunk people instantly became sober in the church, or how telling someone very sincerely that god loves them brings them to tears (I'm not referencing your story here. I was told this a LOT) as well as the teachings of the prodigal son.  
  
These teachings and emotional responses were engrained into my head and the emotional responses in me were triggered by events/phrases/emotions that bore similarity to the stories I was taught growing up. It's indoctrination and programming and it's fascinating how the brain can be trained to invoke certain responses. This is what is known as [conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_conditioning). Don't sweat it. This will happen. Just remember to use your head, not your emotions. It's going to take time to tear down the religious conditioning. It took me years.

Two new releases in the last week - the first was my standard monthly release, and the second was a bug fix release to fix the ""rest"" command, a bug that was reported to me via email.  Other than that, I added some functionality to allow inventory/equipment cursing in anticipation of making cursed items unequippable (release early!  I didn't notice this until someone pointed it out), and making angry deities curse your possessions.",1100.0

"I have tried correctors. I tried light bisque and it didn't help. I tried a little bit and it looked like I had none on. I tried a bit more and it just ended up caking when the concealer was applied on top. I've even tried skinfood salmon corrector, Benefit erase paste (and all the other under eye stuff they make) and Pixi concentrate. Neither did much for my circles. I even tried NYX HD concealer in lavender and green.    

I've tried most correctors and concealers recommend (drugstore &amp; ME). 

I haven't tired the bare mineral serum concealer. I did try the brightener in the wand form and it didn't do anything for me. ",1100.0

"&gt; Yes, but why? Anyone can tell you that it isn't rational to presume anything until the relevant evidence is in.

because the presumption of guilt in the face of incomplete information results in many imprisoned innocents and jail as political payback.

&gt; This is just ridiculous hyperbole. There's a world of difference between using a preponderance of evidence standard and setting up a medieval Star Chamber or a Soviet kangaroo court.

1. you asked about the presumption of innocence
2. we already have the kangaroo courts

&gt; Like I said, no rational arguments, just sanctimoniousness, slippery-slope paranoia, and character assassination.

all you've got is hate for the accused and tears for the victims. facts are secondary",1100.0

I'd really encourage you to find a like-minded training partner who's after similar goals with a similar work ethic and schedule.  The time's I've improved the most is when I've had this relationship with another teammate, on days when I was sore or felt like taking it easy I knew I had to push myself or I'd be cheating my dude out of his training.

"Adidas sponsor hundreds of teams out there, and the vast majority of those teams were given a set number of templates they had to pick their teams kit from. That might not sound bad, but back before Southampton established themselves in the Premier League they couldn't return to their striped kit because it wasn't a part of the templates that every club that wasn't a major European giant had to pick from. It's why Southampton made their own kit last year, and it's why we (Bristol City) continue to make our own.

£1B is a stupid amount of money, but only when you consider the sheer lack of effort they put into supporting the vast majority of their clients.

It's their money to spend, so I'm not fussed that they're willing to chuck money at Real Madrid. I just wish that they would just stick to the big teams.",1100.0

jhead is similar to e3d lite6 but with an insulating sleeve instead of a fan.


e3d v6 (now available preassembled) by default can do high temperatures up to 300C.  e3ds also have a ton of accessories and custom applications.  From wear-resistant nozzles to fun stuff like the Volcano they have their own custom use cases.


The Hexagon can do 300C by default, requires a fan, has a generally easy assembly.  The AO edition (special version for LulzBot) has some nice assembly features like a retaining plate for the thermistor.

As for covers, I'm basing that on my experience browsing my local SF/F bookstore (which is how I get the other half of what I read btw).

"These are still copies of Qing Empire coins. The Manchu (which is photographed upside-down :p) on these usually gives the location of the mint of origin.  

The Manchu on the 嘉慶 (Jiaqing Emperor, r. 1796- 1820) coin left reads ""boo cuwan,"" which is the mark for the Sichuan mint in Chengdu. This is a transliteration of the characters 寶川. Edit after seeing a clear picture: the Jiaqing says ""boo ciowan,"" for the Board of Revenue. The reverse of the 乾隆 (Qianlong Emperor, his father, r. 1735-1796) right reads ""boo yuwan,"" the mark of the capital's Board of Public Works. The Manchu is a transliteration of 寶源.

"One could argue that working immigrants are contributing to the economy of their new countries by engaging in the workforce and spending money (on rent, food, etc.); they're not spending 100% of their gross income on payments to their families back home.

At the same time, if there were some sort of structural reason that they could not send money back to their relatives, immigration rates would likely decrease because the portion of new immigrants coming for the purpose of sending money back would have no reason to immigrate.

(For example if some hypothetical law were passed which made it illegal for new Mexican immigrants in the USA to send money back to Mexico, immigration rates from Mexico might drop by a certain amount, potentially leading to a drop in the labour force in certain industries which rely on cheap labour.)",1100.0

Hillary, she just acts like it doesn't exist sometimes. 

And in a way, I can respect that. If it was a ""I'm just getting these questions because I'm a female politician so I'm not going to answer"" or some shit, fine. That's like Neil Degrasse-Tyson denying questions about what's its like to be a black scientist. I can respect that, hell I love that.

"&gt; ich täte sie ficken, which I would translate in the past tense as ""I did fck her"" or ""I fcked her""

More like ""I would fuck you"", which would make the most sense. Täte is present subjunctive, not past tense. sie is most likely formal you, not ""they"", seeing as there's not much proper capitalization on the note.

&gt; Ich will dich Tole küssen = I want to kiss you (dropping the ""Tole"", which makes no sense)
 
Not tole, it's another misspelled täte -&gt; ""I want would kiss you""

If the language compiles to bytecode, like C# or Java, then the user needs to have the appropriate runtime installed to interpret/compile the bytecode, but you don't need the compiler installed.

"My ex also relapsed on heroin while we were together. He had been clean for 7 years. I helped him numerous times get into rehab facilities, supporting him all the way. We married and had a child and he continued to relapse every so often. The lies and stealing were endless. The final straw was when our daughter was 3 and he repeatedly punched me in the head because I refused to give him cash that my father and given me. He was arrested, put in mandated rehab and lost custody of our child. I divorced him. He still continues to use. Please please think long and hard when planning a future with an addict. 90% of heroin addicts relapse and you never know when it's coming. I hate to be Debbie Downer but that's the reality. I'm now happily remarried to a man who has never touched drugs or alcohol in his life. I just wish I'd gotten out sooner than I did. Good luck. ",1236.51782

"It's just an ignorant, naive mindset. 

When I saw the post that IBP threw the game and were permanently banned, I (23 yrs old from NA) was curious to what the other punishments were for match fixing in other sports. I knew vaguely that people threw sports in the past and were banned for life as well, but didn't really know how normal it was (partially because sports don't really interest me). 

Turns out that permanent bans are fairly common results of match fixing PLUS jail time, which IBP didn't get. And you don't even have to go far to find these results. It's just a scumbag thing to do and people hate it when you fuck with a sports integrity.

So these posts from the past year in support of IBP to be unbanned just confuse the fuck out of me. The only way you can think it would be ""okay"" to let match fixers play is if you are naive to the punishment, or are too ignorant and young to understand how serious match fixing is.

"My fireteam doesn't have issues with DPS on ogres, so using a tether on them isn't as beneficial.  We prefer saving the tether for the 3rd and 4th knight, possibly the vessel.  I'd rather have plate 3 person get off the plate and run to the middle bubbles, tether the middle path.  This will 1) slow down the knight progress, 2) make them quick and easy to kill.  If you have an extra hunter, you can do the same for the 4th knight *or* save tether for the vessel.  our relic runner uses the Raze Lighter so having them tethered keeps them from running away.  If Oryx slams front left or back left, one tether can handle both the 4th knight and vessel on occasion.

When TTK first came out, I did something similar with my Nightstalker because not everyone had Touch of Malices for the first several NM runs.

"&gt;This video example should illustrate how this radical left side bends the story

I'm not asking for a misdirection to the issue of rape apology, or other excuses for non-murder objectionable behavior.

I'm aware that some people minimize the possibility of cultural contribution to rape (which is still not the same thing as saying that culture makes rape okay), but that's not what I am asking about.

I'm asking very specifically if anyone on the left has actually said *honor killing* is *okay,* or if that accusation is made-up bullshit.

I'll believe plenty of bad things about TYT, but that they said honor killings are okay is not among them.

EDIT: also, if you think that TYT video you linked says rapey behavior is okay if you're from a different culture, you should maybe rewatch (or first watch?) the section starting at 7:53 where rapey behavior is condemned regardless of culture of origin.

"cut the veg smaller...just. smaller.

as for deciding how much of something I need for my meals I envision the weight/day totals.

so for 3 meals, I would grab 3 broccoli spears. I would assume each spear would give me about 6oz of edible tops. Rice or whatever, I just cook up 2 cups regardless. I will eat it. The 2 cups makes probably 2 quarts, or 8 cups which is enough for 4 meals. The protein I go for at least 3 oz of whatever. 3oz across the board I found to be about 20g of protein or so. If I want my protein from non animal stuffs, then I calculate the additional veg and grain with the wanted protein amount.

I shop for 3 days worth of prep. I like my food to taste fresh. Sometimes I will make 8 days of food if the situation promotes it. I say, find how much weight you want to eat per meal and this depends on kcal wants. If you want 4 oz of broccoli per meal vs 6oz...that will make a differenceish. ",1275.7089799999999

"I mean maybe. I solidly believe based on the evidence that exists that immigration definitely causes a loss of jobs for Americans. However, I think the net gain to all of the nation is higher than the loss. At the same time, I'm cognizant that the net gain is really made up of large gains to some groups and slightly smaller but still large losses to other groups.

So I wouldn't call it a lose/lose because it really depends on where your self interests lie. I would say pretty much the same thing about automation.

An example: Automation makes my electronics cheaper and that's great as a someone with disposable income, but that sucks as someone who works in manufacturing. The gain to society by having cheaper electronics is probably higher than the total loss to society of the jobs. However every person in society may have gained like 1% gain while a few people lost their livelihoods. This isn't a super scientific debate, its honestly a question of ethics and values",1276.45992

The cost of wind energy has come down significantly over the past 10 years primarily because the energy subsidies made it economical for companies to buy the product which drove companies to compete for that market and innovate to take the cost out of the end product ultimately bringing wind energy nearly to the cost of coal per KWh.

"They are a new club and they attract a lot of guys that are new to the whole scene.  In a crazy coincidence their name sounds a lot like Sons of Anarchy.  Not sure where you are but I haven't heard anything about them being anything but another pop-up club.  Kind of a low commitment riding club but one of the types where calling themselves a motorcycle club and sort of looking the part is a big deal. 

One issue is that their colors are white and black.  Those are also the colors of a few 1%er MCs.  Those MCs tend to be a little particular about their colors.  Also other 1%er MCs who have historically had feuds with any black and white MCs might have some concerns to raise.  So it is disrespectful.  I get it though.  If you put a group of guys together and ask them to design something they will always pick black and white and maybe red.

That doesn't mean he *couldn't* get another QB to a Super Bowl, it simply means Brady has been healthy (with the one exception) and has played well for 15 years.

"&gt; На рубеже тысячелетий здесь жили племена и говорить о каком-то общем языке - ересь.

Славянские племена мигрировали на территорию Руси в примерно в середине I тысячелетия. До тех пор здесь жили балты и финно-угры, действительно говорившие на разных, но не славянских языках - данные ономастики это убедительно показывают. Славянские мигранты говорили на более-менее одном языке, который только начал распадаться на диалекты. Прародина славян - дело тёмное, но она, скорее всего, была где-то к югу и западу от современной территории восточных славян. Собственно, в связи с этой миграцией восточные славяне и обособились от остальных.

"Fair answer. But want you want may not be an entirely new ship, but rahter a 4 phase size 2 shield, vs your 2 phase size 1 stock shield.

Such as one of these:

https://robertsspaceindustries.com/voyager-direct/Seal-Shield-Ink-Splash/INK-Splash-204-IS

Now, to be fair, all of the Hornet variants are waaaay tougher than any of the Mustang variants (s4 shields), even the Delta with its special ""armor."" I honestly think that the shields/armor on the Mustangs is still glitched (though not nearly as badly as it used to be.)

Also, if you have any firepower concerns, be aware that upgrading to a F7C Hornet will give you the exact same amount of guns as the Beta, although one size larger, and that to get any more guns, you'll need to buy the nose canard and/or ball turret fixed mount in addition to the guns. You will, of course, go from 0 missiles to 8.

You've left some small pieces at the quarry, but that's no matter.  These big bones, though...they aren't breaking down.  Got to lose them quick.  Back on cart, drop bones in panic in a rush to get home and act all natural-like before people start coming by to the fire.

Above is the opposite of what I've been thinking; I've been leaning toward not guilty, but I need to run through some theories for guilt before I can really say.  See if some of these theories, when I pass through the whole cognitive dissonance bit, actually ring truer than I may have previously wanted to notice.

"&gt; My parents have been married for 30 years and have always seemed to operate under the belief that the person best suited for a particular task, should make the decision on that task. The other person typically agrees anyway.

And in practice the only difference from my POV is: if there is no clear ""best suited"" to the task and its a stalemate, I'm calling it.  Honestly, I'd see no reason to run over my wife in a decision she knows more about.  She's in medical, so I'm not going to question her much when it comes to medical decisions for our children.  If I have a doubt, I ask a question and we discuss.  I have no desire to literally run everything.  However those things I don't ""run"" I oversee, and that IS a very small but different dynamic I think.  Maybe to most people not so much as to notice it in fact.

"Multi-orgasmic dude, checking in. It sounds like you're NOT having dry orgasms. Instead you are actually ejaculating, but holding it in, probably resulting in retrograde ejaculation. 

With a dry orgasm, you don't have to hold anything in. Orgasm and ejaculation are separate events. So, with lots of practice edging, you can learn to separate them. Mine are about 2/3 the intensity of a ""wet"" orgasm. I feel myself go over the edge, although more slowly and controlled, and I can just hold myself there right before ejaculation. I have the muscle contractions, but no ejaculate and I stay hard. 

To answer your question, your next ejaculation will be normal because you're actually ejaculating every time. Sometimes I like to masturbate dry and have 3-5 orgasms and only ejaculate with my wife. When I do that, my loads are much larger and orgasm intensity is MUCH higher.

First couple days you'll be fairly tired and achy, but you'll have more movement than you might think. It really doesn't hurt that bad. 

You might get extremely itchy, as a side effect of healing, and constipated, as a side effect of anesthesia. Have antihistamines and laxatives ready. 

You probably won't be able to shower for a while, so get some wet wipes or wash cloths or what gave you to stay clean. I suggest getting a haircut and trimming body hair so you don't get as gross and greasy and stinky. 

If you're gonna be on your own, prepare some easy to make meals, or stuff that will keep and you can reheat to eat. 

Pillows and cushions are really nice for helping you stay elevated and not turn over in your sleep.

"A lobbyist is a lobbyist.  It a person or group that advocates for a particular cause.   They aren't inherently evil or good.  They get hired to do a job which to advocate for a specific position on a specific issue. 

 In nuclear, there is a specific policy agency that does most of that work (though each parent company of a plant has their own lobbyist) and they mostly go with ""nuclear is a key component to climate change, along side renewable.""   Take a look at at the nuclear energy Institute and then a group called nuclear matters. Lots of great information. 

Also keep in mind, those private companies also lobby for their specific company interest. The same energy companies that advocate for coal or gas very often advocate for solar and wind because the parent company may operate all of the above. It's about a diverse portfolio, not ethics.

First off I'd like to apologize for your difficulty locating the information you needed on the website, but as far as I can tell all the information is there.

We're a 100% volunteer corps, funded entirely by the university and donations. 

People have claimed hours with us before, but it depends on the situation. Ask your supervisor if it would qualify.

Medics are required to be EMT-Basics, the course is taught through Monroe Community College as RIT doesn't offer it. 

You aren't required to work any specific shifts, you staff what you can. We require 10 hours a month, but you get out what you're willing to put in. I'm a bit biased but I'm adamant this is the best opportunity on campus.

As a freshman you're in the best spot to join. Submit interest on the website and attend an information session, all of your questions will be answered there, or ask me anything else you need.

"The car tunnel through Mount San Gottardo is old, shitty and dangerous. Know the Swiss need to decide wether they want to shut down the tunnel for renovation (for years) or build a new one next to it. The subject is highly controversial because the tunnel links italy and its neighbours with northern europe. this means europe would love to see a second tunnel and the chance is that european pressure might lead to having two tunnels in order in the end. This would cause a massive increase of highway traffic across the country and torpedo its efforts for a railway solution (see NEAT, a new railway network in the alps, linking italy and germany).",1243.68385

Samtidigt så är det ju naturligt att föreställa sig att något enstaka företag skulle avvika från samarbetesstrategin och att alla då skulle vilja avvika och att det skulle ta lång tid för företagens kultur att konvergera till den optimala strategin, så jag antar att det på kort sikt när företagen är unga och obekanta med marknadens jämvikter bör bero mycket på antalet företag.",1100.0

If anyone is interested in SPL, I could try to write up some discussion on some of the matches. There are so many matches every week that I don't think every match could be covered, but I could try to hit the most interesting ones.

I would focus more on the matches than on the players themselves because there's too much drama when you put players into the mix and someone'll end up with hurt feelings, and that's just not good. ",1100.0

Big game and Dog &amp; Duck are similar, but have better prices and will probably be a bit more crowded.

I'm sure the Shem Creek bars will be fairly popular, but the cool weather might keep them from getting over crowded.

Plenty more options - Triangle, My Father's Moustache, Black Sheep, etc. Again, I'm sure every one will have a decent crowd.

"Getting bullied, insulted or threatened online is sadly NOT an exclusive problem for Smash players but rather a problem for all e-sport players in every ""popular"" game. It's a result of Smash becoming bigger. And trust me I have seen worse than what Vinnie experienced online. if you don't believe me go to the big subreddits like CS:GO, LoL or Dota, where approx. +500k people shit on you for no reason (Link, JW etc. to name a few examples)

Let's be honest here competitive Smash (regardless of the version) was never in the spotlight since it's been published. But the popularity of competitive Melee / Smash exploded 2-3 years ago with Twitch and Sm4sh.

Smash however isn't at the point yet where players can actually make a living with it except for the top 20 players, who also stream etc. , which is probably why it's hard for them to ignore online criticism and bullying.

"&gt; I believe that the theory of evolution and the Big Bang theory are simply made up to make a mockery of everyone who believes them. Think about how silly the whole thing looks from the ""evolution tree of life"". A long long time ago you were once a fish, who swim around in the water and ate things like plankton, yummy. Then suddenly decided it was too boring to live just in the water, and life would be much more interesting if we grew some legs and climbed out of the water and started to eat things like leaves, yummy. Before long we turn into chimpanzees, gorillas, apes and monkeys and then we build a spaceship to the moon. Do you see, how unlikely, given even millions of years that a monkey is never going to evolve into a human and start doing the same things that humans do.

The problems mainly started when I was sitting still, trying to pay attention to work, or when I was unloading at my hotel. And even then, it wasn't that bad.

"Så här är det: brottsligheten kommer att öka, som vi ser, som vi sett de senaste 30 åren av invandring från MENA. De är grovt överrepresenterade inom t.ex. våldsbrott, av det kan man anta att desto fler folk vi tar hit från MENA, desto mer kommer antal brott också att öka eftersom de blir en större och större grupp. Att man önskar att den här ökade brottsligheten drabbar de som är skyldiga till att ta hit just den här gruppen är väl inget mer än poetisk rättvisa. 

Om du och jag bor ihop och du bjuder in en mördare: så är det väl mer rättvist att du blir mördad, och inte jag?

"Well, I can tell you the GOP just changed the rules (with Ron Paul literally at the door of the national convention) in order to keep him from even having a voice on the floor.  (They changed the minimum states from 5 to 8, thus disqualifying Ron Paul from entering as a candidate.)

Remember that each political party is really just a private corporation.  They make their own rules and follow their own programs with no public oversight at all.  The debates are run as a joint branding exercise.  Even if Mr. Sanders actually wins enough states enter the convention, the party can choose to simply omit him from the results and bar his representatives from voting for him in the convention.

For those of you who don't know, Buddy Rich wasn't just a jazz drummer like Ginger Baker or Gene Krupa. He was a literal FREAK OF NATURE on the drums with an equally legendary bad temper.

There's a story of scientists measuring footage of his one-handed rolls and figuring out that he literally had one of a kind reflexes. This here is some legendary footage of him. Next to nobody has since been able to accurately replicate this drum solo.

Buddy Rich and Ginger Baker in my opinion are two of the world's greatest drummers. Sure there's keith moon, neil pert or John Bonham, but when comes to utter raw skill, nobody can beat Buddy Rich.

Still, he has an addiction with modding his vapes to the fucking max.  Like, it's god damn ridiculous.  The batteries it takes to power his shit is absurd.  He has a few dozen ""base"" vapes (not sure what to call them) and hundreds of different mods, some with LEDs, design, etc.  It's become a collection and he even makes his own formula from vegetable oil(?) and some other crap.

"&gt;日本人の民度がまだまだ十分高くないから。

在日は謂わば「帰る国」のある難民。

ただ世代を経て母国語を理解できるのは少数だし、しかも母国は経済危機真っ只中だったり、将軍様が幅を利かせる国だったりする。その上母国に帰れば同胞からいじめられたり、ハブにされたりする。向こうからすればどっちつかずのパンチョッパリだからな。

つまり自由が無い。帰ったところで何も出来ないから帰らないだけなんだよ。

民度がどうとかではなく、この件に関しては難民処理に失敗した日本国と、それが失敗する様に仕向けたGHQ及び連合国が全て悪い。

また、日本人と朝鮮人はぱっと見見分けがつかないので、日本人側は朝鮮人を区別したいと考えている。日本人にとって在日朝鮮人は、すぐそばにある『未知』だから、怖いんだよ。

しかし朝鮮人側は区別されたくない。出来ることならわりかし平和な日本に住み着いてしまいたいと考える。
ということで帰化した者達が日本の社会や政治に紛れこみ、同胞への優遇政策を働く。

朝鮮人からしても日本人は未知だ。朝鮮人だとバレたら何をされるかわからないという恐怖におびえている。そのストレスは半端じゃないだろう。

日本人の言うところの区別は、在日のいうところの差別。両者とも根本的に考え方が違うから、そもそも話が咬み合わない。

というわけで朝鮮人側はヘイトデモという強行手段に出たんだけど、在特会と在日がズブズブなのが判明し、自作自演がバレてしまって今ココという状況。

"Chakra is Microsoft's new Javascript engine.

As you know, Javascript is not a compiled language, but there is still an engine that has to interpret and execute the code.

It all started with SpiderMonkey, Firefox's JS engine, which goes back all the way to Netscape Navigator. Back then however, JS was not what it is today and not nearly as powerful.

Many people attribute this recent (~5yr) JS resurgence and growth to the release of V8, Google's JS engine which changed the game and brought huge increases in performance.

NodeJS for instance, uses V8 as its JS engine. So in a sense, V8 made our whole ""Universal"" JS ecosystem possible.

Now MS has come up with a new one (which they use in their latest browser Edge); and yes, you will be hearing a lot from it because it appears it has pretty pretty good performance, possibly better than V8.

"Hi there ! I'm about to go back to this game and I've been browsing dozens of guides and forum posts concerning class balance and gameplay.
I can give you an incomplete look at the stamina classes that seem good atm :

- Stam nightblade : powerful while leveling and for endgame content. Provides great dps.
Prefered weapons : 2h, dw, bow

- Stam templar : powerful builds exist but some players complain that there's not enough stamina morphs for class abilities.
No idea how it fares while leveling.
Probably has a 2h+bow build

- Stam DK : powerful especially in endgame pvp. Apparently quite annoying to lvl up due to lack of sustain at early lvls.
Popular weapon combo : 2h / bow, 2h / 1h+shield.

- Stam sorc : no idea, I'm not attracted to its fantasy at all but some viable builds exist (have seen forum posts).

Keep in my mind this is only research. Hope it helped anyway

Edit : reading the post above, I may have confused stam dk and templar concerning the lack of stamina morphs for class abilities.",1250.99232

Still, don't knock the ""manly"" options.

It is different from the psychoanalytical approach because it isn't concerned with the unconcious meaning behind a special behavior, but it aims to change the behaviour.

I agree with the principle that we need not prove that a sign or wonder didn't actually happen in order to invalidate the authority of the one working the wonder. 

However, I think that the video clearly shows that ""angels"" are crudely produced image overlays. Look at where the people are looking when the video shows the wide ~~angle~~ angel view.

Good approaches make for easier putts. If you can land in a 40 foot circle you have a max 20 foot putt. With just a little practice you can do better than this.  Then, as long as your drive is in the fairway and the hole isn't way long, you can get up and down from any half assed drive.

When we met with some guy in a hunting stand he had a car tent and we traded a few things. Then my friend followed him and had a fire fight with someone, it could've been him. I wasn't there to know. 

P.S. As for my friends cannibalism, I have no idea what was going through his head, when he was trying to explain that. 

P.P.S. We had 3 people at the base. He logged off and then me and the other guy went to the base. You could've seen a third guy go in but he wasn't with us, or you could've have seen us with different gear because we were swapping like crazy when we got in.

"People like to say that ""their"" drivers are the worst. It's a stereotype we hear all the time, ""Oh, Bay area drivers are the worst"" or ""Bostonians can't drive""

No, you don't understand. BC is really fucking bad. I've been everywhere and Vancouver is hands down the worst I've ever seen. There is a light at the end of the tunnel though. A lot of the bad driving is due in part to to local traffic engineering that deliberately makes driving more dangerous to try dissuade people from using their cars. That means narrow lanes, traffic light timings that cause congestion, and pedestrian controlled traffic lights that use a stop sign for cross traffic. Top it off with a local government insurance monopoly that doesn't give a shit and charges through the ass and you have the perfect storm.

So when you say your drivers are the worst, just remember. No, you could be in Vancouver. Your drivers are second worst.",1252.17036

So prices may go up but there will be an offset balance of profits that will have to go down to keep the prices at a reasonable place.

I understand that a player could exploit mothball mechanics, but even that gets expensive. Maybe a fort could take 3-6 months to exert a ZoC again after being reactivated instead of just one.
Think about this example. Ming builds forts along it's whole northern border (a virtual Great Wall). They also have a fort in every province directly south (like a second Great Wall).

"Dearest Diehard Rengar Mains,

Do not fret. Don't let the cries of the disenfranchised ""Rengar main"" impostors fool you. Rengar will maintain his viability regardless of what Riot does. For when the bandwagoners have have abandoned hope, the true Rengar mains will emerge from their dens reinvigorated. Once the victims of a 50% ban rate, now free to exact vengeance upon those who dared to speak out against us. We will show the true might of the double-edged sword the community has presented us. Their outrage and vilification of us is our opportunity to thrive in the shroud of obscurity. So to my fellow hunters I say this: persevere. The trials ahead will test your mettle, but what lies on the other side is an eden of unfettered dominance. Sharpen your blades, the hunt is soon to begin.",1100.0

I have dabbled a bit in the past but it was more for enjoyment rather than cost saving.

"Hi,

I'm Charlie, a 27 year old tech support specialist for a major ISP in the US. At work I'm known for both my performance and patients with customers. I originally went to college to be a teacher, but changed my major to IT. I bring the skills I learned teaching to work everyday, and try to help those who are not tech savy. I have a deep passion for helping people, the elderly, and technology. 

My business idea:
I want to sell my technical teaching capabillities to senior citizens. I have always admired their generation, and find myself enjoying being around them. Unfortunately, senior citizens tend to not be very good at technology, and this can lead to a loss of communication with the world and family. 

I want to empower the elderly with technology, unlocking a whole new world for them.

I'm not sure how to get started. My only marketing idea here is to go to senior living residences and see if there was any interest. Any other ideas or help would be greatly appreciated. ",1251.952148

"Just a few small additions:  
  
 * There is no such prefix as K. The kilo prefix is a lower k. The upper K is the unit kelvin (temperature change, temperature with 0K (absolute zero) as reference).
 * The gravity unit is the lower g and not the upper G which actually stands for the gravitational constant.  
 * Weight is a force [N] and thus a ships weight is the result of its mass [kg] multiplied by gravitational acceleration [m/s²].
 * The cargo mass gets divided by the world settings inventory multiplier. Thus if you play with a multiplier of 10 a cargo mass of 400 000 kg gets divided by 10 down to 40 000 kg.
 * Atmospheric thrusters have a thrust value depending on the atmospheres density which decreases the higher you go. (Same goes for electric ('ion') thrusters but in reverse, the higher the atmospheric density the lower the thrust value.)",1100.0

"I'm a beginner to the game but I realized that having a controller would make the game more enjoyable for me. I went a little bit different and went with the Steam Controller. 

Now at first glance it may not seem like a good controller but I absolutely love it. The triggers have a 2 stage pull so I pull halfway to go forward and then pull all the way down for boost. That way I control acceleration and boost with 1 finger. Plus I love having jump on the paddles behind the controller. My fingers are already there so I just squeeze to jump.

- I didn't choose this base the clan war algorithm chose it for me  
- I don't have access to dark spells as my factory is being upgraded.



Current state of my plan:

1) clean up the surroundings with wizz on the west side and archers on the east side. Wait for cleanup and send killsquad on the west (because multiple target helltower)  
2) if I go basic gowipe, they will turn around the center since there is a ring of defenses.  
3) Using hogs to funnel killsquad to the center ? afraid of giant bombs which should be located next to air sweepers.  
4) with a proper funnel and a jump spell, lucky enough to get the TH ?  


army comp intended :  
- 2 freezes, 1 rage, 1 jump  
- 25 archers  
- 10 wizzards for cleaning up (-&gt; 40 space)  
- 2 golems (-&gt; 60 space)  
- 15 hogs (-&gt; 75 space)  
  
20 space left for killsquad. Not enough damnit

So there are no snapshots/migrations required, we will just send you a new email with a new IP and login details after each rebuild.

"This is mostly based off of EU, but I think it's a reasonable explanation.

Midichlorians are only the conduit through which the Force passes to influence life. A Jedi having higher midichlorian counts does not necessarily make him more strong in the Force, it only gives him more potential. The higher levels of midichlorians a Jedi has, the more Force energy he can channel through his body without destroying the cells. Someone can have low midichlorians and do amazing feats, but they began to glow as the midichlorians were overcharged. Eventually, the midichlorians would become pure Force energy and the Jedi would die having given up his midichlorians to completely channel the Force. I would guess that's similar to how becoming a Force ghost works as well. We haven't really seen someone channel the Force that intensely in the new canon yet, afaik, so, we'll see if something similar happens in the years to come.",1100.0

"lowell madams and från shammo the two biggest people at the helm came from VZW. they have implied and sometimes said bluntly that they don't care much about the wirelines side of the business (and despise the copper portion entirely). they want to separate VZ from VZW, preferably selling VZ entirely to someone. In fact they almost did it six months ago. allegedly the proposed deal for a french company to buy VZ assets fell thru because of sensitive contracts VZ has with the government that prohibit foreign ownership. They will sell their copper assets and probably the fiber side too and probably soon. Frontier just bought texas, CA and Fl wireline (both fiber and copper) and said they will expand FIOS availability there. so it isn't a lack of money or a labor issue or anything other than sheer lack of interest.",1238.231648

"I hate being that guy, but if you were to google something like ""why is sugar bad for you"", you'd get thousands of articles to read.

To sum up an answer though, glucose is not bad for you. It is used by the body as the primary source of energy. Consuming sugar is good if you are active, since its converted to energy so easily, and an athlete, or even amateur fitness dude, should be consuming a good amount of carbs and sugar.

TOO MUCH sugar is bad for you. It damages the liver, is easily converted and stored as fat, can decrease the bodys ability to produce insulin (causing diabetes), its addicting on a chemical level, it raises cholesterol, triglycerides, and other bad things you don't want in excess in your blood... the list goes on.",1100.0

"In what sense does this help you guys as a business?

I'm a loud proponent of wotc's ""stupid"" decisions elsewhere because there's usually a business reason for it, but I do not understand the business impetus behind cracking down on fringe events that ultimately exist in part to keep this format alive in parts of the country that don't have enough folks with enough cards to play.

I play legacy weeklys with 20+ people on weekday nights and we get 60-90 people for legacy weekend events for ""win staples"" events all the time because I'm in SoCal, but when I lived in the midwest we had 4 legacy players and 7 decks between us and it was 3+hour drives to SCG events to even get to play, and SCG has cut out legacy support as well.

Is the goal here just to kill old formats?  Is the hope that this will somehow devalue the cards and make it easier to abolish the reserve list and bring these back?

What the hell is the business reason behind stopping these tournaments specifically?",1240.19798

"There is not magic shortcut you can take to be good at RB. 

You have to learn your planes, what they are good at, what they are bad at, the opponents planes and how to exploit weakness. 

So for that I usually turn to Youtube for reviews of planes *Magtv* is a pretty good source for honest opinions of planes and excellent advice on how to fly them. 

You also need to learn flying style, Turn and Burn, Boom and Zoom, Energy Fighting or Jack of all trades. 

You should find out what you are most comfortable with and find planes that suit that style and then move onto other styles when you feel confident enough. 

I personally am a terrible Turn and Burner (Spitfires/Zeros/Ki-43), average energy fighter (Bf109s), average Jack of all trades (Yaks, Aircorbas) and a good Boom and Zoomer (Fw190, Cousairs)

"I know about this in only a few specific contexts, but within Tibetan-Mongolian-Chinese relations, the titles (not sure if this is exactly what you mean by nicknames) were given - and often demanded - as part of the ceremony/arrangement. Many great lamas, emperors, kings, etc in the Tibetan-Mongolian-Chinese sphere have extraordinarily long names, and the length of the title is often an indicator of their fame and power. For example, the full religious names of the Dalai Lamas is often about 10-16 syllables long and might read something like ""The Ocean of Wisdom, Protector of the Teaching, Moral and Compassionate Supreme Lama"" or something like that and these were absolutely applied at the time of coronation/installation. The exact wording was often the subject of controversy and dispute among kings-emperors-lamas competing for power and prestige.

"[editado] Galicia tiene varios inconventientes: es muy rural, es una de las comunidades más envejecidas, es históricamente pro-caciquismo, y muy de Fraga. Todos estos factores obstaculizan para el cambio.

Pero si nos fijamos en las ciudades grandes gallegas, son pro-podemos, más incluso que Madrid o Barcelona: 

 _ **Vigo** (municipio) : ""A marea - Podemos"" **ha quedado primero** con un **33.94%**. 

 _ A Coruña (municipio): Podemos ha sacado un 31%, aunque el PP le ha superado con un 31,5%.  

 _ Madrid (municipio): Podemos ha conseguido 20,82% y si fuese con IU/UP se le sumaría su 5.33%.

 _ Barcelona (municipio): EnComú consiguió un 26.57%.

Estamos ahí.

El problema ocurre si nos vamos al interior o a los pueblos. Cuanto más pequeños y rurales más tiran al PP. Hay municipios donde incluso se supera el 80% de votos al PP como Avión (82.5% PP) o Bearíz (83.03% PP) . La Galicia rural es feudo del PP, y uno muy complicado.",1100.0

A small nitpick(sorry if you already know all that and just phrased your post ambiguosly):

Hormones aren't magic pills that turn a male into a female. For someone who's past puberty all they're gonna do is affect some body parameters(muscles, fat distribution, skin, hair, breasts). For some MtF(Male to Female) transgenders hormone replacement therapy alone isn't enough to visually pass as a woman due to things like bone structure.

It is because the phone have frontfacing speaker. Motorola decided to use increasing volume on devices whit front speakers. The only fast solution is edit the sound and put 2 seconds of silence first. That will use the increasing volume and after that 2 seconds the notification will sound normal.

I can't see mindfulness meditation having a negative effect on creativity because if anything it makes you more aware of abstract thoughts that are otherwise ignored by your attention system.

"? common sense means this is stupid. They seized ~$270mil of ivory - regardless of what happens to it, poachers are getting $0 for that. Flooding the market with that legitimate/seized stock would then drive the price down &amp; lower the incentive for poachers - destroying it just leaves the equation unchanged.

Limiting the supply even further isn't going to lower demand. Shit, the best thing you can do is take the profits from seized ivory and use that to educate people on the horrors of elephant poaching.

"I don't say this to brag, because there are certainly far better pub stats but more so to somewhat validate my opinion, but as a 2+K/D player who has played since MW2, Quickdraw, at the least, is essential.

Unless you're planning on playing a heavy control game, (ADSing around every corner, primarily sitting by headglitches with an AR watching choke points) then Quickdraw and Fast Hands are absolutely crucial. Any second you gain in ADSing and being able to shoot someone first greatly increases your chances of winning that engagement.

As for general attachment setups: 
Most subs require Quickdraw+Grip with the occasional stock and then extended mags on the Vesper or the Kuda. 

AR's vary a bit more but unless you particularly enjoy the iron sights I would recommend some combination of Red Dot/ELO Quickdraw + Grip + Stock + Long Barrel + High Caliber. 
Of course, don't think you need to run all of those, but thats pretty much a baseline. Hope this helps.

"I am an Applications Engineer for a small semiconductor company. I love Apps Engineering. I get to solve engineering problems, but my pay is based on making my sales numbers. I really like the results-oriented part of that. I have worked for four different companies doing Applications Engineering; here's my pros and cons list of working in sales:

Pros:

Results oriented; anyone can argue with your methodology. No one can argue with results.

Real human interaction - It's all about being in front of customers

Great mix of technical problem solving and human persuasion

Cons:

The travel gets old; I hate how much time I'm away from home.

""Results oriented"" can be a double edged sword. Sometimes you have a bad quarter...

I've ALWAYS picked apart your threads and everyone else's threads, reecent affairs have no influence on that stuff one way or another. 

&gt; I was talking about Skull Face, and the fact his name most likely references his most identifiable feature.

It's funny, cause I even explained how that string was incredibly confusing (along with others). There was no reason to include ""His name isn't Man on Fire"" there in relation to Skull Face, so I assumed you must have been talking about the actual Man on Fire. 

&gt;Clearly you can't follow along. The opening bit was more of a play on words than it was serious. Aka, Sin and Pain sounds similar to Yin/Yang.

I feel like his excitement to be a dad is secondary to his excitement to bank our son’s birth for spank material later.

Verbalize this to him in a slightly more delicate way. If he's as involved and supportive as he has been, hopefully that means your communication is on point. I would approach it gingerly because he's going to be *extremely* embarrassed when you call him out... and most people would jump to denying/being defensive in this situation.",1283.050048

"&gt; But the bread and wine are not changed

This is indeed Lutheran doctrine.

&gt; So calling the bread the body of Christ is symbolic and one should not concentrate on the bread itself but feeling the presence of the holy spirit

This is not Lutheran doctrine. 

While I'm not super well versed on my Lutheran doctrine, it holds that the bread and wine continue to be bread and wine *while also being Christ's literal body and blood*.

&gt;because when the priest blesses the bread and wine they become the body and blood of Christ and therefore should not be shared with someone who does not appreciate their significance.

This is, perhaps, a bit of an oversimplification of the Catholic view of who should and can take the Eucharist.",1269.117152

"I agree that the vast majority of gun crime occurs in poor urban areas. That doesn't make attempting to reduce this crime by banning guns any less legitimate.

Switzerland is a small edge case and has relatively relaxed gun laws compared to most of the rest of Europe - but still very restrictive compared to the US - as you point out, the absence of a significant number of large urban areas probably contibutes to that a huge amount.

Sure, having access to guns isn't then only factor influencing gun crime rates, but it sure is a necessary factor. Ths UK has large urban areas with drug and gang crime problems on a level comparable to some US cities - but doesn't have anywhere near the same problem with gun crime.

Now given abolishing cities and spreading the US population out to the same population density and average income as Vermont isn't a realistic solution to the problem then perhaps controlling some m of the other variables such as ease of access to guns might help?",1100.0

* Set MyFitnessPal to lose 1 kg per week.  
* Supplement with 1 hour/day cardio exercise.  
* Spend some time [lifting weights](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) to save lean body mass and eat an average of 110 grams of protein every day (MyFitnessPal can tell you how much you're getting).  

10-11 kg in 9 weeks is slightly faster than recommended, but it's possible because our initial weight drop (first couple of weeks) usually has some added water weight in it.

b. The wear and tear from this fuel would cost a fortune to upkeep.

&gt; Federal habeas review did not extend to those in state custody until almost a century after the nation's founding. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, as later during the War on Terrorism, the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus was substantially curtailed for persons accused of engaging in certain conduct. In reaction to the former, and to ensure state courts enforced federal law, a Reconstruction Act for the first time extended the right of federal court habeas review to those in the custody of state courts (prisons and jails), **expanding the writ essentially to all imprisoned on American soil.** The federal habeas statute that resulted, with substantial amendments, is now at 28 U.S.C. § 2241.

I'd say Sarries will win QF1.

Wasps will win QF2 though it could be close if Chiefs have their injured players back.

Leicester for QF4, as much as I'd like STF and their sexy pink kits to go through.

From Sarries v Wasps I'd probably go Sarries again to get to the final.

Racing v Leicester, would have to go Racing.

Consoles of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras were highly-dependent on fixed-function graphics hardware.

They typically didn't have frame buffers, and their CPUs were probably too slow to fill a frame buffer every frame anyway.

His mom completely ignored it too. Literally everyone in line complained about them after they left; they held up the line quite a bit in addition to making a mess. I'm not sure I'd want to live my life like that.

When I'm working though, I prefer the teaching method of getting things put away. I tell the kid directly that we shouldn't go making messes and then ask them to hand me whatever is on the ground, then show them how to put it back. Some parents go with it and are great, others are embarrassed but don't know what to do. Either way, I've never had anyone get upset with me and it can be fun to teach kids stuff like that. It's a fairly safe way of dealing with it, and if you're in a rush, then you just have the kid help a small amount.",1100.0

"They're going to poop. Their main function in life is poop. 

You can lay down pee pads in corners (as most prefer to poop only in corners) or invest in a carpet cleaner/shampoo machine. The poops are tiny and easy to clean up so that is a plus. 

I'm not sure on the allergies thing. I'm allergic to cats (but still have one in the house) and my ferret doesn't give me any trouble. 

You will need to keep your printer in a place that the ferret cannot reach. It will not figure out not to touch it. Ferrets will become fascinated by moving objects and frequently try to grab/eat things that could really hurt them. One of the reasons so many ferrets get blockages.

"No, you won't get ""full custody"" if by that you mean full legal custody and she never sees the kids. You might get a very favorable parenting time schedule, but she is going to see the kids, probably a lot. Working with a lawyer to put the right argument together could help you minimize the time she spends with the kids, especially if she is using drugs again, but drinking and grinding at clubs is not enough.

Yes, you could owe your wife child support depending on the parenting time schedule and your respective incomes. Likewise, she could owe you child support, we just don't have enough information to tell you.

With a six year marriage and her having a job, I wouldn't expect you to pay alimony, but again, without all the facts, I can't give you a more concrete answer.

&gt;If ever we were to touch Zyra, we'd probably try to make sure she continued to be viable as both a support and mid laner, though it would be a really great thematic fit if she were shifted to the jungle imo.

"A good galactic hitchhiker never leaves home without it!

EDIT:

“A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.”

"&gt; However, what he mentioned is actually rooted in the way the enemy fights, i.e. the weapons and tactics they use and how he prefers something to come straight at him.

I did say I don't like how the Illuminates fight. I didn't say I prefer that things come straight at me. In fact, my exact words were: 

&gt; I really enjoy the mobs and tanks dynamic that both the bugs and cyborgs have. It rewards specialization in a way that I enjoy, and the Illuminates don't really do that. Now that I think of it, I enjoy the cyborgs more than I enjoy the bugs. The bugs just rush you. The cyborgs do all sorts of things. Does that make me a Borgdiver?

I actually said I prefer the cyborgs because they come at you in different ways instead of just running at you.

The price difference isn't even that large if you just go for a few appointments and skipping the wait time is at least for me worth it.

" Shaft (1971) Gordon Parks

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067741/ [6.6]

 Cool black private eye John Shaft is hired by a crime lord to find and retrieve his kidnapped daughter.

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1098038-shaft/ [89%]

Shaft, a highly successful film, spawned an industry of sequels and imitations. The daughter (Sherri Brewer) of Bumpy Jones (Moses Gunn), a (white) gangster, has been kidnapped by a rival (black) gang. Bumpy hires private detective Shaft (Richard Roundtree) to find her. Shaft gets some assistance from Lt. Androzzy (Charles Cioffi) of the NYPD, who hopes to avoid a gang war, especially one which could lead to open racial warfare. The other person who helps him is Ben Buford (Christopher St. John), a black militant who also wants to avoid race war. Shaft is tough. Shaft is smart. Shaft succeeds. Isaac Hayes won an Academy Award for the title song.",1243.81876

Am I just going to hate battle spot and getting 1-2hko in everything cause i'm not rolling with perfect stats on legendaries, or even just using some regular pokes in their place?

"You've got quite the rare car there, friend! I don't know if you know this, but they only made ~475 rubber bumper BGTs, and it's actually a 1974 manufacture date.

In 1974, the US law changed so much that the MGB had two bumper iterations, first for MGBs produced late fall of 1973 to mid year in 1974 (these are considered 1974 production cars though). In the middle of 1974 the bumpers changed to conform to new US law. The combination of lesser sales, higher curb weight/HP ratio than ever before, meant that production of BGTs halted after the 1974 production year. This would be considered a ""1974.5"" car.

Pretty cool piece of history you have there!

As a fan, I would love to have seen Ambrose vs Reigns at Wrestlemania, but if you look at it from their side it makes sense not to put Ambrose in so the fans won't boo Reigns out of the building.

* Boost Speed increased to 3750, up from 3000.
* Boost energy drain increased from 25, up from 20.

If a bunch of enemies swamp you at once, the AI turret's going to perform better, although you're still likely to lose because the gun on it isn't THAT great.

In addition, one can simply leave the turret and fire their regular weapon which, combined with the surprising amount of cover provided by the AV turret, can do the trick.

The AI turret should definitely be improved, though. I think that even if the head was covered by the shield, it still wouldn't be that powerful. Perhaps it should have some more shields and an increased turning angle, but make the shields breakable. ",1251.3548

As a guitarist it's hard not to compare the classic synths to the most used guitar shapes.

I used to work for a microbrewery and once went to belgium just to drink beer so I know a little bit about beer compared to your average guy. I went in to WOB 3 times. Ive always gone with people who dont know much about beer and they ask the server for suggestions and the server has almost without fail messed up the style or flavor profile of every beer every time. I don't correct people or make a deal out of it but if they are going to be WOB they should train their staff better. I think whoever the manager is there must be pretty terrible. You can tell there is just something off with the staff. Its just a weird place overall. I think it'll get better in a couple years maybe but right now its just meh.",1246.801352

King uses that scene to have us appraise how *we* react to uncomfortable or challenging situations. Readers, myself included, are generally off-put by *that scene* because King expects us to be.

I wiggled my toes under warm blankets one last time before the anesthesia began.

Throughout this body eating sickness, I dreamt of my shadow turned corporeal, an amalgamation of plague to hold me beneath the murky depths of sleep so tiny mouths could chip flecks of bone from beneath my flesh.  Once I closed my eyes one, all I could see was his horrid face, a demented smile to greet me at the end.

"Not everyone's life will be changed by psychedelics. The changes don't come from the drug they come from you. The drugs are just catalysts but not everyone understands this. They aren't some miracle wonder drugs that will fix everything. Therapy will never work on a patient who doesn't want to change just as an alcoholic isn't going to quit drinking until they want to. And even if you wanted the drugs to help you they might not. I was lucky in that LSD made my life noticeably better. Even my family and friends have said that I've seemed happier and more engaged. I attribute it to my wanting to change and using psychedelics with specific goals in mind. There's nothing wrong with recreational use of psychedelics. It's just as fun and cool.

- Master bedroom - bedroom only sanctuary - no computer/distractions. 
- Second bedroom - office for computer and/or getting things done. 
- Third bedroom, game/hobby space - keeps your living room more grown up.

It's sad how overzealous moderation in r/europe created a void and then that void was filled by something quite monstrous.

"If you're trying to emulate the Stasi you are going to have to accept that they were an unpleasant organisation and thinking about how people would feel, as said by u/Grine_ will get in your way of portraying a realistic and believable agency in a totalitarian state. Personally I'm quite interested in the GDR/DDR, I would say a book named ""The GDR: A history of the workers and peasant's state"" by Jens Schöne is a great read, discusses more about life, but discusses the Stasi and how they entered public life and how they effected the everyday. Maybe also look at organisations in Soviet Poland,  Hungary and Czechoslovakia who had a similar role to the Stasi, of course the Stasi are most notably the most infamous and ""successful"". 

My advice, don't be too afraid to emulate them in order to achieve your Stasi style organisation, of course mix in your own flair to make it a bit unique so it doesn't look as though you've just copy pasted the Stasi. ",1100.0

"BH&amp;R was ahead of it's time musically. When it first came out, people were fairly confused, we didn't know what to think. There were tons of sounds I never heard before in rock. I really liked the album, but like many was somewhat disappointed- not because of the music but because it changed what Muse meant.

Fast forward a few years, and BH&amp;R finally all made sense. Those sounds started popping up everywhere in Music. This made the hype for The Resistance was incredible. The worldwide hunt, the USoE snippets. I remember the iTunes previews came out, and my heart sank (along with almost every fan at the time). None of these songs sounded heavy or inventive. The album dropped, and our fears were realized. Muse went too far, tried to repeat the sound breakthrough BH&amp;R was. Then there were tons of new Muse fans everywhere, blasting the stale sound of Uprising on repeat, making us older fans cling to the earlier albums.",1300.0

"I believe downsizing for cartilage piercings is usually done within 6-8 weeks - my piercer told me 2-4 for my conch. I didn't have much swelling at all and I keep bumping the bar when putting up my hair, so I'll probably go in next week. Cartilage does generally take 6-12 months to heal (but sometimes longer), but it's my understanding that the long bar - while necessary initially for swelling - will cause more issues in the long run than a quick downsize by your piercer.

They're great and all, but I wanted maximum expandability and the need to buy expansion units for synology turned me off. Plus I wanted the option to do crazy things down the road, like create VMs to run things like pfsense... or even a simple web browsing windows VM for the misses if I can ever convince her to drop her 6 year old macbook air off a cliff. Also IPMI is the bomb. As long as it's plugged in with the power switch on and 1 ethernet cable plugged in, I can do things like hard resets and change low-level BIOS settings from a web browser, no physical interaction or bloated software installs required.

"&gt; No matter how big the guns you put on a turret are the mechanics will always be too simplistic to consider it a profession.

True. But with all this complex simulations this game has, some people *want* that simplicity. This is great way for non-gamers to join in and help out. And maybe...get them interested in trying out other parts of the game.

A great example is if you're a dad who has a 3-year old who wants to ""help out dad"", but can't fly one of these ships. It's just too complex for your typical 3 year old. Stick them in the turrets. Then it's a matter of ""point and click"".  You both share in the victories and defeats. Father and child, completely different skill levels...working together and having fun.

This is something you don't have in your typical multi-player environment. You don't want an unskilled 3 year old on your team in Counter-strike. But this allows for completely different skill levels to obtain objectives together. So, for me... I want the turrets.",1258.51344

Line the underside of the shelf with led strips (I like the ikea ones that have screw on clips for mounting,as you can replace the shelf easier) and put together something that lets you hang full sized bulbs across the pit. 

In a pit, no one is going to say there are too any lights or too many outlets - go crazy.

Most of the plants you eat need soil to grow.  Soil is a complex mixture of stuff including decomposing organisms and the waste (poop, urine) of those organisms and others.   

It's also home to a huge variety of tiny organisms that are constantly multiplying, dying, getting eaten etc.     That's known as the soil food web.   

The vast majority of plants also absorb radiation from the sun as well.

"It's the Dahmer/Dobler theory (credit to HIMYM). A creepy act (a ""Dahmer"", referencing the serial killer) is made not creepy if the act is towards a person who likes you. The titular example is when Dobler, John Cusack's character in *Say Anything*, does the famous thing of showing up to the girl's house, blasting Peter Gabriel on a boombox. This scene could easily being in a stalker movie, but because the girl likes him back, it's cute and romantic.

This applies to many other things like the wedding scene in *The Graduate*, Edward watching Bella sleep in *Twilight*, and the cliche ""Cute boy stares at girl because she's so beautiful.""

"*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***Female Sprawl***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=female+sprawl) : 

---

&gt;When a woman on public transit uses the seat and/or seats next to her to store her purse, handbag, backpack, etc in complete and utter disregard for the actual paying customers of said public transit that are left standing because their Coach bag is too expensive to put on the floor.


---

_I was on the bus the other day and a lady had her purse taking up the TWO seats next to her, in typical Female Sprawl fashion. I politely asked her if she could move it and she refused. I then told her that if it doesnt have a fucking ticket, i'm sitting on it._

"I found an article that I remembered I had read months ago:

http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/193989/the-roots-of-mindfulness

Interesting hypothesis:

&gt; It makes sense that Buddhism in general, and the vipassana practice in particular, resonated so strongly with these largely secular, modern Jews. As Wilson points out, Buddhism had one important commonality with psychoanalysis: Both locate the source of suffering in the mind. The Burmese vipassana practice is particularly focused on grasping how the mind works. “One of the things about the Burmese tradition is that the paradigm for the inquiry, you could almost say, is a psychological paradigm,” said Goldstein. “It really has to do with an emphasis on the understanding of the mind. There’s a very detailed analysis of the mind, there’s a whole part of the teaching which we could call Buddhist psychology. I think that fits very well into the American and perhaps Jewish cultural way of understanding things.”

"1) LDRs require trust- jealousy of every 'cute, fun' guy who comes into her life is not healthy

2) You can't make a person in a relationship stop talking to/hanging out with a friend just because you're jealous. That's controlling and it will ruin the relationship. ESPECIALLY as she's not your girlfriend right now!

The worst that she can do is say no to you asking her, but I'd say the first thing you need to do is assess for yourself whether this relationship is worth it. You're both young, and you seem to have some issues with trust and perhaps self-esteem. I'm 25, my boyfriend is 26, but we're in a relationship from Canada (him) to the UK (me), the only thing that makes it work is absolute trust, honesty with our feelings and frankly the ability to meet up every once in a while. He'd tell me if he was jealous, but he'd know I wasn't trying to make him jealous, and he wouldn't expect me to change my behaviour or my friendship from him.

Some of the annoying things about GZ can be gradually mitigated with research and buddies if you want that, altough you are also totally capable of going in light for the fun of it if you feel like it.
(Also sensible if the mission just doesn't call for everything and the kitchen sink and you feel like you can use very minimal equipment to accomplish the task.)

You also have a much larger potential variety of weapons, and you can even do cheeky things like steal AFV's and even tanks, either in missions, or by fultoning them when that becomes available and deploy them. 

Using a tank to takeover a base or finish something will obviously kick your score in the teeth because of alerts and the fact that you are killing people so ""no no kill bonus"" but it's also pretty fun.

"Well it is really. You can't say that the Islam culture is incompatible with western life when it has been proven by millions of Muslims that it isn't.

I'll concede that the Muslims that choose to come to the west do so because they want to live in the west. That fact implies that they have researched the west, they wish to live alongside the western culture and are therefore much more likely to be able to do so in harmony.

What you see happening at the moment is a form of culture shock. Many of the people arriving in the west probably don't even want to be here but the alternatives are much worse. I'm in no way excusing their actions and they should be punished in the same way you or I would be if we acted in that way.

The problem I have with your comment is that you simply cannot look at these incidents and conclude 'Muslim culture is incompatible with western life'. It's simply not true and it's incredibly unfair on the vast, vast majority of Muslims.",1100.0

Progressive rock (loads of that), ambient stuff, soundtracks, rock, metal, jazz/motown, occasional reggae, classical, world, indie, acoustic, occasional pop, experimental pieces, melancholic stuff even a few guilty pleasure tracks like ""The Rivers of Babylon"" by Boney M. I'm sorry, this must be the Kanye West fanclub. I don't how anyone can appreciate the music of a man who interrupted someone during an awards speech and then tried to do the same again a few years later. And I don't even like Taylor Swift and Beck. Also, pretty much all rap is lame to me, predictable, uninteresting, disaposable. It's impossible to care about what a person is saying if they're saying it in that fast, annoying in-your-face way.

**Gohan:** It seems he's somehow become a Super Saiyan God.  
**Kuririn:** But Gohan, take a good look at him. Goku's hair is blue!  
**Tenshinhan:** If I remember it right, it was red when he fought Beerus.  
**Kuririn:** Has Goku reached a level even higher than what he was at back then?  

While it's true that Goku has [absorbed](http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/battle-gods-animanga-akira-toriyama/) SSG into his base form, his ki hasn't been completely replaced by it. He's still senseable, at least according to Super. SSGSS on the other hand is simply SS1 powered by godly ki, which is why Goku cannot be sensed after transforming.

"My guess is that happiness (as well as other emotions) are effective at interfacing with the ""logical"" part of the brain that is needed to solve problems.  Perhaps other animals also have such emotions to some degree.  Take a newborn goat, it looks pretty happy as it plays; this in turn is encouraging it to develop the agility it will need to survive.  So if a human child is happy it is probably learning physical and mental skills quite efficiently.  Then, as we become older, we need to actually achieve more to get the same emotional reward: we are problem solving creatures and so that reward/penalty system is built into us. This also explains why there is a negative connotation to certain emotional states and others are positive.  ",1300.0

EG: One for support/heals, one for DPS, one for tanking. Since we'd have no class distinction, those COULD be the only meta builds we'd see from a min/maxer perspective. Of course, I am using the words might and could because I am not really sure what would happen.

Maybe we could have a class quest where you could unlock one single class skill line at a time, and only have one active. That would give us more flexibility and open us up to different builds. Could have an awesome quest associated with it.

I would love to just see more skill-lines open up for various other activities. Or more morphs would be cool too. Hell, even a third morph on the class skills would be interesting. 

Fishing passives would be interesting. 

My two cents. ",1286.685288

"Having actually bothered to read through all the patch notes now that it's live - This patch is ridiculous! I can't believe how many good small balance changes they've made. You can really feel the care and attention they've put into it, especially the rift guardian boss changes and QOL changes. Getting hellfire amulets is a pleasant experience now and gold/gems actually feel valuable again.

Only a few things left to moan about now!

- Can't view equipped passives during grift easily
- Huge focus on gear synergy makes many builds seem very static in their item and skill choices (Just pick everything that buffs thorns damage am I right?)
- Infinite paragon progression makes competition impossible for people who don't grind 10+ hours a day.",1100.0

"Schools and districts have ""zero tolerance"" policies to make it more difficult to get sued.  If you were to punish two instances of the same policy violation differently, it's easier to sue.  Applying the rules across the board without any leeway essentially makes it impossible to have discrimination or unfair treatment.  So if the policy is ""kids can have prescription drugs with a prescription"" then they've got to justify why hydrocodone isn't allowed but asthma inhalers are.  Instead they just institute a blanket policy that even covers stuff sold over the counter.

Basically, it's lawsuit prevention.  You'd be amazed at how much money public entities lose to lawsuits on a regular basis.",1252.77438

"they are fundamentally different kinds of synthesis.  the keys is subtractive, which is the more common sort.  oscillators go into a resonant filter which sonically feels like it 'pushes down' on the top of the sound, muffling the higher pitches and driving up the harmonics.  think of big whooshy filter sweeps, that's subtractive synthesis.  analog.  

the FM is.. FM, frequency modulation.  sound is made by different oscillators affecting one another.  the classic sounds are clangs, big round cheesy 80s sounding bass, grinding metallic noises, sega mega drive music.  but also capable of quite warm mellow sounds.  all digital.

so the sound design is completely different.  however in terms of actual playability features they seem relatively similar, they are both the 'volca' model, having a sound generator, sequencer (play back series of notes), chords, automation of parameter changes, arpeggiation (?), various effects etc.  they will not be worlds apart to use although the controls will be different.",1100.0

"There is no fail-safe way to pinpoint any one cause of erectile dysfunction, so it is often necessary for you to sit down with your doctor and together consider all the factors in your medical history that might be causing your ED.

That said, if you’re a relatively young man under the age of 40 and are unaware of any physical ailments, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, or high blood pressure that might cause erectile dysfunction, then the odds are that your ED is psychologically rooted.

To see whether anxiety over your sexual performance might be responsible for your problems, do a little soul-searching on your own. AskMen.com suggests that performance anxiety may well be the culprit if you often obsess over “how long you lasted, how good or bad you were in bed, what your partner thought of the sex, [or]a past sexual experience that didn’t go as planned.”",1264.558386

"In my opinion I think vertically down your back starting halfway down your shoulder blade would look the most tasteful. I don't like leg tattoos unless a person has them on their upper body as well but it is such a personal decision. I have one across my back in that area and it hurt more for me when going over the muscles than the spine. I did not use color though which some say is more painful, especially red, but I don't know if that's true. With color you do have to consider fading though and retouching to keep them nice. I would worry about that many animals on your hip or side if it goes low enough if you ever want to get pregnant. Google pregnancy tattoo mishaps and you will see what I mean.

"Urgh! that's unfortunate.

Certainly check for any noise on the line using a handset and report it. There might well be a nick in the cable, or it was installed badly.

A couple years ago I was in a fairly new house, and I had loads of problems with the connection. It was 6Mb, then it would slowly drop down to about 0.5 over 24hrs, then it would mysteriously recover after a few days. So, by the time the BT guy came to check it, it was working again.

The BT guy tested my line, and it came up perfect. I told him that it crackles, but only sometimes. 

He sat there for 10 minutes and listened and then he finally heard one single crackle. This was enough for him to call out the  OpenReach guy. The BT guy replaced my wallplate, and the OpenReach guy checked the line in the pit.

They didn't detect any problems, but it worked better afterwards. Most likely because the OpenReach guy had to disconnect, restrip and reconnect the cables in the pit.

"I've tried Jester in a variety of builds and even with the one I currently have, he's too lackluster to put onto a team.  Currently I'm running Occultist/Grave Robbber/Abominatiom/Jester and I've realized over time that the jester's only redeeming feature is his stress heal.  Other than that, his base damage is too low to justify ever using him for damage even with finale critical.  I've found that buffs in this game aren't really all that useful; in the time you use to cast 0 damage buffs, you can kill off enemies so that they don't get damage out.  He's only remotely useful for buffs on bosses since the fights are drawn out, and even then it just seems to lack impact compared to someone like MAA.  I think Jester would be better if his base damage was higher or if finale/solo wasn't so weak.

He ""volunteered"" (acted of his own will without a legal obligation) to ""pilot"" (control or guide) ""highly"" (very) ""dangerous"" (potentially causing injury or death) ""drones"" (aircraft capable of autonomous flight).

You might ask why a drone would need a pilot?  In 1943, Allied drones were crude and incapable of taking off by themselves.  A human pilot performed the takeoff and parachuted out over friendly territory.  The Nazi drones were took off from special ramps and were completely unmanned.

In Joe's case, he was about to jump from the drone when it spontaneously detonated.

"Prayer of Saint Gregory by Allan Hovhaness. Super simple to play the notes and it's beautiful. It relies 100% on the performer to make something out of the simple, scalar lines. Also Vocalice by Sergei Rachmaninov.

The triplet feel in Mvt 2 of Haydn and Hummel seem to make them less lyrical and more pulsing and rigid in non professional players (ie. solo and enable festivals I have attended or adjudicated.). And they get played so much that professors will undoubtedly have preconceived notions on how it should be played.

"I have to hear about this type of relationship a lot from my husband who passes on all the gossip from his job (military). But it's funny, bc he says the men always talk shit about their women/wives and he gets made fun of for ""respecting his wife's opinion"" on things (like me not liking guns so no guns in the house etc) and that if it was their house they'd just say ""bitch were getting a gun and that's that."" And then my husband has to point out that he's heard their wives bark orders at them and they do it in a heartbeat. So it's basically all bullshitting and machismo really; neither of the relationships described sound healthy imo, neither of us bark orders or think we're the boss, we base our relationship on mutual respect.

I think it would be fine with a rain shell over it, at those temps you'll be dealing with snow more than rain. You might want a shell with pit zips though to help prevent moisture from sweating too much.... As for sizing, I'm 6'2"" and 170lbs and I'm a medium shirt size, the medium jacket fits me great! It has a sightly more athletic cut to it so it fits a lanky guy like me very well, and the back length and arm length are perfect for me.

As someone who commutes to college and some days has three or more hours between classes to fill, it's convenient for me to bring a 3DS with me. Even the N3DSXL is easy to bring back and forth because it folds in half (which both makes it easier to fit in the top pocket of my backpack, but also pauses the game and preserves the battery).

He has a right to be a really somber and depressed character, losing his father at a young age, being a part of his adoptive father's death just because he wanted to see Elise, and after all his hard work, his love still died. All those reasons are probably why he wanted to leave France so eagerly, so he can forget all of those harsh memories that occured in that city.

Healthy skin is around 5.5. 

&gt; What pH should your cleanser be?

Around 5.5 ideally. 

&gt; If the pH of my cleanser is too high, is this were the toner comes in put the pH down or what?

Exactly!

&gt; If, for example, the pH of my cleanser is 6.9 and the pH of my toner is 5.5, and I use the toner right after, is the pH on my skin then 6.9 or 5.5?

After you cleanse with a cleanser with pH 6.9, your skin's pH will eventually return to normal. The toner, I believe, just makes that happen faster. I imagine after using the toner, your skin would be somewhere between 6.9 and 5.5, then slowly return to normal. ",1288.271368

"Yeah, but Nerlens is not doing a good job on the perimeter anyways.

Last year players shot 4.7% better when being guarded by Nerlens at greater than 15ft from the rim. And this accounted for 30.5% of all shots he defended.

**greater than 15ft**

Player | FREQ | Diff%
-|-|-
Nerlens (2014/15) | 30.5% | +4.7
Nerlens (2015/16) | 18.7% | +1.6
Jahlil | 27.8% | +4.6

PS: Jahlil's opponents shoot -4.5% when he's defending them less than 10ft from the rim. His problem is really not contesting shots, it's being able to rotate correctly and be aware of what is happening on the defensive end. Compare that to Kanter's -1.4 this year as a reserve. Previous two years +1.3, -0.3. Al Jefferson last 3 years: +2.4, -1.8, -3.1.

Personally I found its better to use the credit card for essentials ONLY. So I use it for grocery shopping which is the only real necessity (at least for me at this point)  and for Public Transportation as it gives me 3% Cashback. All the other expenses come from my debit account.  This way I am never spending more than £300 at the most which I am able to stay on top of. I am not a crazy spender but did find I was falling behind on my card when I was only using it for all my expenses. This works well enough for me. ,1100.0

I just don't think of what I do in those terms. I make observations and apply principles to advocate for better ways for people to live and achieve happiness, productivity, and social harmony. I suppose looking at it through the effect vs morality lense, I use both in that quest. Maybe the way I think of it, they're inseparable. Morality is based on principles that maximize goodness, which should be translatable into an effect. Maybe I'm at my best using both simultaneously.

"Of course it is, I in no way implied that it was not. I was saying that its unlikely that slut shaming came about as a way to stop women from asking for sex so much. Rather it is more likely an extension of fundamentalist judeo-christian theology. Much in the way that telling a person to cover up rather than telling another person to simply stop looking at them, shaming a person sexually allows you to feel better about your own insecurities and urges without having to address them.

Slut shaming is often found to be prevalent amongst women, as a form of bullying designed to curb the power of other women. Far from internalised misogyny, it appears to be a method of regulating power between social groups, much in the way that machismo is used by men.

"That makes it more interesting than previous AR implementations since it's not just superimposing graphics over a 2D image, the space has been converted into 3D. This gives potential for CG characters to interact with the environment. So intead of just two CG guys fighting on an invisible floor they could hide behind real objects that have been converted in a collision mesh. It's most likely been pre-created, but there are tools to generate a real time 3D space. Project Tango is an example. https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/ 

Real time conversion into 3D is essential since it let's the user and environment occlude graphics rather than always being behind them. If you ever watch a Hololens demo you'll notice the demonstrator never occludes anything CG because they can't do it in real time.

Y ahora, después de perder una guerra, pretende tener poderes discrecionales otra vez para tratar de ganar una ""guerra"" que perdió y/o arreglar los problemas que su incapacidad nos trajo a nosotros. Así estamos.

Lo bueno de todo esto, me parece, es que como este decreto NO va a funcionar, ahora si creo que un revocatorio podría ganarse, porque ¿en que cabeza cabe que se puede incentivar la inversion extranjera al mismo tiempo en que un gobierno puede basicamente ""tomar prestado"" cualquier recurso existente en el país, público o privado, para supuestamente asegurar un bienestar que no existe?

Brady and Belichick in their weekly interviews are very respectful of their opponents and other players in the league and it isn't just to build up the opposition.  

So you can see that here in full display.  

Some of the Broncos are still taking about rubbing nuts in Brady's face and whatnot and then you have players like TJ Ward that show their disrespect in how they play.  Of course, guys like Mankins sure showed signs of that too.  And I've been on both sides of the view on Rodney Harrison.

The squiffers and bamboozlers have rifle range so are more vulnerable when they miss, and the long charge time of an eliter is very frustrating when you start out learning chargers.

EDIT:  I would suggest the standard splat charger to start.  Having bombs to drop at your feet can be clutch when short range foes get close.

"&gt;most recently is the fact that `""` is the system clipboard

not quite: `""` tells vim that you want to specify a register to use. By default, vim uses the register `""0`, so typing `yw` has exactly the same effect as typing `""0yw`. You can use every letter as a register as well though, so for example you can copy a word into register `""a` by typing `""ayw` and then paste it by typing `""ap`.

There are some special registers: `""*` and, as you say, `""+` interact with the system clipboard (see `:help clipboard`).

You can see all the registers that are filled with `:registers`. You can also get more information about registers by using `:help registers`.

Oh, and one more thing: You can paste from any register in insert mode by pressing `CTRL-R`, so `CTRL-R``a` will paste from the register `""a` and `CTRL-R``+` (or `*`, depending on how exactly your clipboard works) in insert mode will paste from the system clipboard.",1100.0

&gt;I'd agree with most of that, a minor point though.

&gt;The first group isn't worth thinking about, the second group does have a fair point as Sansa's character development felt like it kind of went backwards a bit and there is more potential for interesting plot where she is in the books, however the show has deviated to a point where it can't be expected to follow anything close to the books plot and so nothing it does will ever quite compare.

I can't come up with a single portfolio that includes Total Intl Stock Market that outperforms or at least gets the same returns of a US-only portfolio. Switching the international allocation to emerging markets only does change the game though.

Another thing I've found is that historically an equal weighting among large, mid and small cap has higher returns than the total stock market with weights proportional to capitalization. Tilting the equal weighting towards value stocks yield even higher returns in the long term.

2 days later, Rommel launched his major flanking assault on the British Gazala Line.

"&gt; The series is JUST starting getting the attention it deserves in the west now.

But it's BEEN getting very good attention in Japan for the better part of half a decade now. There's a prominent speedrun community that's very competitive, but they aren't monetized. The entirety of the western install base isn't even 2/3 the size of the Japanese one. Again, I think if something was going to happen, it should have already happened.

What I want to hear is how this IS viable. The only point of merit you've made is that the West is just starting to get an audience, but I don't think that's a good enough.

The best education you can possibly get comes from getting out and seeing the world, and you're gonna have the funds to do that soon!

Failures are hard to cope with especially when so many people depend or look up to you, but it only shows you're human. If you ever come to a point where you have doubts on yourself, take a moment to stand down and think of where you went wrong.

a leveled-up chewy has the 8th most health, and a leveled-up poe has the 12th most health.  and poe's tenacity is number one overall by a large margin.  if you field a quick burst team (e.g. a team of droids), that 2nd turn taunt can save your ass.  and once poe is leveled up fully, his health and dodge are enough to usually keep him alive for the full two turns.  but again, even if he doesn't stay alive, he's done his job by taking two turns worth of ammunition.  someone else mentioned to me that poe's health stats don't become good until level 5 or level 6 of gear, and that's spot on.  while i farm poggle and old daka, my poe+JC combo has kept my droids in the arena winning column.

"Bowlers win tests and Waugh had McGrath and Warne two of the best bowlers ever. Smith has three quicks with a lot of potential and a solid off spinners. 

Let's not romanticise Australian pitches though. They have always been very true and we'll suited to Australian batsman and bowlers. In Waugh's last test series when he was without McGrath and Warne that was also a massive batathon because the back up bowlers struggled to take wickets. 

Australian pitches have been discussed a lot lately. Statistically they are only really flat for Australia. Australia is bowling other sides out consistently. Since 2012 Australia is averaging under 30 a wicket with the ball which is pretty much about what other bowling attacks do at home. Also since 2012 only England and the RSA have a better touring win loss ratio. 

Maybe Australia is just extremely good in Australia. ",1293.3667

Think of yourself as sometimes addressing the audience, and sometimes actually being a part of what you're describing.

So what you do is when you start off - be kind of in the middle of the area you're given. When you want to drive a point home, walk closer to the audience and speak in a more confidential tone, and when you're sort of re-enacting events, more walk back and forth horizontally.

You might even want to start off with you're back to the audience, gesturing to the two sides with you're hands, and then turn around.

It's less about hand gestures and more about using your entire body as you read - and using distance and space to make a connection with an audience, just as when you're talking to one person you may lean in to make a point.",1244.6135

Gibbons spells everything out in detail from the ground up and includes problems to help you test your understanding, but a bit of mathematical maturity should probably be considered prerequisite.

To the author of the post: I suggest clarifying what the category underlying the F-algebra/initial algebra/catamorphism is in the examples you give. There are also a couple of errors, e.g., stating that the objects of the category of sets are the elements of the sets (the objects are the sets themselves).

"I work in TV. I engineer a TV truck and also did transmission/uplink for a while. Can confirm - 1080p is RARELY IF EVER a thing. Almost everyone/everything is 720/60p or 1080/60i. Fox/ESPN are 720p, as would be ABC, CBS is 1080i. 

TV shows can film/edit/take their time with the data 1080p takes, and output their product to whatever the format the networks are. Then on things like netflix/blu ray/whatever - they are actually 1080p. 

Not a lot of TV trucks can do 1080p, and on a side note 4k is so beyond reasonable expectations for live-broadcast. I'm surprised they're selling 4k TV's like candy right now. The cameras cost a huge fortune, the gear isn't cheap to be able to handle that much [you're basically taking a 1080p truck and multiplying by 4]... it's.. beyond my mind

But since TV's are all LCD, the signal easiest displayed is progressive - and most boxes might as well just scale everything to 1080p... not that the source content is 1080p... ",1100.0

"Hey guys, I'm just looking for some advice on Jersey tournaments on which I should go to. I've been really wanting to go to a major tournament for a while, as I enjoy the local and bi-weekly scenes, but the three closest to me are Shots Fired 2, Do or DI, and Apex 2016.

&gt;However, camping out in the spawn is poor sportsmanship. It highlights your weaknesses as a competitor and does not improve your skills as a player. In fact, it does the opposite.

Your saying that people are weak competitors and are ""poor sports"" for simply using a strategy. Maybe looking down is a harsh word to use but it does come off like that.

I have gone flawless using basically every strategy and can say it all depends on the team, but saying that players can never get flawless by camping is just untrue and if a player that doesn't have the gun-skill to play your way, this heavily discourages them.",1240.655828

I think your biggest obstacle is going to be the curvature of your starting materials - you will need to get a clean, single ply to work from. You will need flat starting material, and most skateboards only have the section from truck to truck (2""x18"" about) flat. The rest of the board will be waste, you won't be able to work with the curved parts. 

Edit - just looked at some pics, I guess some decks are flat all the way across the short way (toe to heel), so you could cut the nose and tail off, leaving you with 8"" x 18"".

I wasn’t  a newb but didn’t have much experience with edibles. I bought a hash oil chocolate bar and the budtender told me to have 1/6 (bar was split in 6 pieces) and wait 20 minutes if I didn’t feel anything then go ahead and have another piece. I repeated this process for about an hour and had no effect so my train of thought was “this is bullshit” so I went ahead and ate the whole bar.  About ten minutes after I started to feel a nice little high so I go buy some Chinese food and  by the time I was done with the food  I realized I was the highest I’ve ever been. I stumble back to my car and realize I can’t drive in that condition.

"**Jarl** or **The Duke** are both excellent 2 player games that take up very little space (the board is about 1ft x 1ft). I would recommend these over **Hive Pocket** (or any Hive version) for two reasons:

1) Hive doesn't have a board and it sounds like you have limited space. The playing space in Hive could spill beyond your playing space depending on the game (not likely, but it could happen).

2) The Duke (and Jarl as they are essentially the same game) has a very chess like feel to it which older people seem to get. In the game, you win by capturing the opponents Duke (or Jarl) like with the King in Chess. Hive, while similar, feels a bit more abstract to me as you have to completely surround the opponents Queen Bee (Hive's version of a King) to win. Not a huge difference really, but it is something.


Hive Pocket would make a great choice too as /u/myWorkFilter pointed out. I think The Duke or Jarl might be the better option in this particular instance, but you can't really go wrong with Hive. ",1244.547654

I had a scrotectomy (and orchi of course), and the incision and tissue removal basically stretches from a centimeter away from the anus up an inch or so along the penis itself.

I've got this hard 'ridge' of swelling along the incision line that's rather numb to the touch that runs along the area. Makes sitting fun.

My surgeon said it looks normal at this stage.

I guess any tissue manipulation down there just tends to swell heavily?

" “I've noticed a fascinating phenomenon in my thirty years of teaching: schools and schooling are increasingly irrelevant to the great enterprises of the planet. No one believes anymore that scientists are trained in science classes or politicians in civics classes or poets in English classes. The truth is that schools don't really teach anything except how to obey orders. This is a great mystery to me because thousands of humane, caring people work in schools as teachers and aides and administrators, but the abstract logic of the institution overwhelms their individual contributions. Although teachers to care and do work very, very hard, the institution is psychopathic -- it has no conscience. It rings a bell and the young man in the middle of writing a poem must close his notebook and move to a different cell where he must memorize that humans and monkeys derive from a common ancestor.”

McQuaid turned his face to the boards, placing himself in a vulnerable position.

&gt; Sill finished his intended check, as most players would do, and did not accelerate into McQuaid or use excessive force to deliver what should be expected contact. The Washington player also had the presence of mind to deliver contact off the centre of his opponent’s back and numbers.

"Yeah, it really was my first impression that she just succumbed to the elements. She was clearly in a state of panic well before the crash even happened, and for her to have disappeared that instantaneously I can only think that she ran, and probably got lost. I've been lost in a forested area much smaller than what lies around there, without the extreme temperatures, and it can happen quite suddenly, especially if she was drunk, as the wine all over the car would seem to suggest.

To me, the biggest questions are just what her plans were prior to the crash and what drove her to that state of mind. The hit and run incident just prior to the disappearance does seem somewhat plausible, but in any case she was clearly not in a stable mental state.

I mean, I'm just speculating like the guys on the podcast do, but I don't believe in a big conspiracy like some people seem to want it to be. They will say there were no footprints into the woods, but who could know where she really ran.",1236.73278

"What might be tripping you up here is that there are two correct answers.

You have two points,

P_1 = ( x_1, y_1 )

P_2 = ( x_2, y_2 )

D^2 = ( x_2 - x_1 )^2 + ( y_2 - y_1 )^2

And rearranging things based on your knowns...

sqrt( D^2 - ( x_2 - x_1 )^2 ) + y_1 = y_2

But note that in computing and with calculators and such, the square root is generally going to return only a positive value, when technically, both the positive and negative values are correct.

Your distance is sqrt(50), the difference in x is 5, and 5 squared is 25, so you know the unknown y value needs to be 5 units away from 1, so both 6 and -4 are correct values for what you're looking for. Both (6,6) and (6,-4) are points that are the correct distance away with 6 as the X value. You'd need to know if the second point is supposed to be above or below the first.",1248.682546

So for this title it would be something like:

Vanilla is the lack of a scenario, so vanilla cutclean would not make sense in this case. A scenario description is also required.

I would also recommend formatting your post so that it is easier to read. Double spacing the text will make it go on separate lines. For example, in the edit or submit page:

"&gt;1881年、世界一周旅行の最初の訪問国として来日した国王カラカウアは明治天皇に謁見した際、ハワイ王国の安泰のため日本とハワイの連邦化を提案した[2]。その時のカラカウアからの提案は次の通りである。
&gt;
* 日本・ハワイの連邦化
* 日本・ハワイ間のホットライン敷設
* 日本主導によるアジア共同体の創設
* カイウラニ王女と山階宮定麿王の縁談
&gt;
同じ有色人種である日本人のハワイへの移民（当時のハワイは西欧からもたらされた疫病により、原住民の人口が激減していた）   
日本政府はアメリカとの対立を避けるため、これらの提案を「良友　睦仁」の御筆の入った親書をもって丁重に断った。しかし、移民の促進に関しては問題がないと考え、1885年には日布移民条約が締結され、官製移民団が組織されるようになった。官製の移民は1885年から1894年まで続き、総計29,339人がハワイに渡った。

"But still: how will your players get their hands on these cards?

As I said above, a lot of stores don't like stocking new TCGs, because of the potential they'll buy a box of boosters, and end up not selling any of them - they don't want the chance of taking a loss on an unproven product.

If you're selling direct, I think you're asking a lot of new customers (I don't know you from Bob, so I don't know if you've got a swath of popular games under your belt already) - in that you're asking them to take on a new game, learn a new game, and like it enough to buy the randomised boosters.

TCGs aren't my thing (that's my bias, but I've been trying to stick to the facts and the common wisdom), but I can't think of a new TCG that's gained traction lately, whereas LCGs/XCGs and are gaining ground, as it doesn't have that meta element that you're fond of.",1100.0

"I have three recommendations. 

First, try the book *The Pursuit of Happiness* by David Myers. This is a book by an academic psychologist summarizing the results of thousands of empirical studies on happiness. Myers is religious and injects his own values into the book a number of times, but I suspect you will still get a lot out of it even if you're secular.

Second, read some ancient Greek philosophy. The ancient Greek ethicists were all concerned about how to acquire eudaimonia, and offered different approaches to achieving that more or less agreed upon goal. Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Epicureans all offered potentially useful perspectives on how to become happy.

Third, and this is more controversial on my part, I recommend the works of Ayn Rand. I have consistently found her advice about how to reason and become happy to be clear, practical, and useful. I am in fact an adherent of her philosophy.

I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.",1300.0

Part of the studied vagueness of the joke allows for either stupidity or a total lack of a sense of humour to be the reason that each man requires the joke to be explained to him separately by our protagonist; this also plays into the dry Euro stereotype of not having any fun/any sense of humour, which can also incorporate the humourless German stereotype.

Would definitely stay away from anything like a square toe. Anything that bulges or comes to too sharp of a point is dangerous.

"If you want them to be stiff and hold you're ankle, then you should be good.  They lace up pretty much as tight as you want them to.  The laces themselves aren't anything special.  Seem like normal cloth laces with some wax on them maybe?  they've held up, and are not overly long.  I have found, and you shouldn't have a problem with this, that lacing them tight helps them fit better than if you just get them barely snug.  The shoe moves better with you, and it doesn't hurt the bottom of your foot as much.

They really are nice boots, they are just a bit.. hard for my taste.  I wore boots for 8 years in the military, and those were much more comfortable, albeit less attractive.  I'm sure you'll love them, and I hope you do.  I recommend taking the time to lace them initially, making sure the laces are flat on the tongue etc.

"That isn't the root.

The root would actually be ""Greed"". There are thousands of players in CS:GO who gamble legitimately through alternative sources. If anything gambling will become widely more popular, especially as Bet365 and betway both entered the CS:GO scene last year, not to mention the many other sites that have entered eSports over time.

Would you suggest that Valve fix them all and prevent those sponsors helping sponsor the game? Otherwise it's going to be incredibly difficult to keep the game growing at it's pace without the element of betting/gambling. I myself don't particularly care, but I see the pro's and con's of betting/gambling.

As I said, the root cause to all this is pure and simple human greed. Where there is money, or money to be made, there will be attempts at making profit. You can't stop it, but you can sure as hell make the consequences severe for those who try.",1100.0

AoR sees the least use at my table. So I might suggest leaving it to last, if your players do not express interest in a military/war driven story.

**Art. 1.** A technical foul shall be assessed to a player or a substitute for the following infractions:  
...  
**i.** Reaching through the throw-in boundary-line plane and touching or dislodging the ball while it is in possession of the thrower or being passed to a teammate outside the boundary line as in Rule 7-4.6.b.  
...  
**l.** After a team warning has been issued, attempting to gain an advantage
by interfering with the ball after a goal or failing to immediately pass
the ball to the nearest official after the whistle had been blown.

Warnings are issued for delay of game, for leaving the coaching box, and for minor bench or coach conduct violations. All other fouls are issued without warning.

See also rule 7.6.9.b:
&gt; **b.** No opponent of the thrower-in shall have any part of his person over
the inside plane of the boundary line.",1100.0

"Are you sure Cruz could bring a case? I don't think he can seek declaratory judgement regarding the definition of ""natural born citizen"" until someone tries to bar him from seeking the office, which no one has done. 

By the way, the statute, governing eligibility is the Constitution.  The definition of natural born citizen was clarified in the Naturalization Act of 1790 which stated ""the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens: Provided, That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States."" Sounds to me like Ted is good to go. 

This is all laid out in a pretty accessible article in the [Harvard Law Review](http://harvardlawreview.org/2015/03/on-the-meaning-of-natural-born-citizen/) written by a pair of liberal and conservative legal scholars.

Personally I don't want this to break the balance in place that quirks vary widely but can be dangerous and lethal not just on a one to one person scale and that the regulations, restrictions, and laws are in place for a reason.

"update - 2 weeks post op

healing took off like a shot.  Still have a pretty large hole in the palate where the incision was made.  The flap is basically off to the side and not where it originally was, which was in the middle of the incision.

But, things are starting to heal up and the hole/incision is closing.  Seems almost like the flap is like a doorstop, keeping the palate long while the incision heals and closes.  Kinda wish they told me thats what would happen - but maybe that doesn't happen everytime.

Anyway, still sore a little -  less everyday.  Nose looks good, so does lip.  Lip is still numb, but I expect this and expect it to recover fully (btdt with LeFort 1)

"Because the phase changes happens at particular energy levels, which can be measured as temperatures.  Using water as an example, if the temperature (energy level) is below freezing, the molecules are locked together in crystals, an don't move in relation to each other, just vibrate (how much they vibrate depends on the temperature).  If you keep adding energy, the temperature rises until it gets to zero, then the added energy starts melting the ice.  You keep adding energy and the ice will keep melting without raising the temperature, until it is completely melted (the molecules are all free to move around each other but stay together), then the temperature of the (now liquid) water starts going up again.  The same thing happens when the water starts boiling.  No matter how much energy you add, the temperature of the liquid water will never exceed the boiling temperature, it will just change phase into gas (where the molecules completely dissociate from each other and diffuse into the air) and drift away.",1100.0

"I think you're skipping past at least two good reasons for fanfiction at that level. A) they really liked the story/characters/experience/whatever and are using their art as a sort of catharsis since there's nothing else official. 

B) They're uncertain in their talent (or very certain of their talent, and shrewd) and are using a popular medium like Undertale to get guaranteed traffic. ",1100.0
"What I think /u/edsc86 is saying is that although buying more tickets *will* increase your odds of winning, there will still be a very minuscule chance of actually winning. 

The chance of getting the jackpot if buying one ticket is 3.42 x 10^9. Buying two tickets increases this to 6.84 x 10^9. Either way, you're nearly certainly *not* going to win the jackpot. ",1271.860672

"I hate cow parsley (parsnip), it is all over my yard and it doesnt like to go away, and it doesnt make good food. It is also a severe skin irritant that is activated by the sun. I have known two people who were sprayed in the face/eyes with cow parsnip juice while weed whacking and they had a sloughing rash for weeks afterward and permanent loss of vision. 

Cow parsnip can get to be about 6 feet tall if you let it, the stalk is juicy and hollow, and about an inch around. It smells musky and metallic and sorta sweet, almost a sickening smell. The leaves are large and broad and sort of look like maple leaves. They can get to be bigger than your head. The flower is a cone shaped mass of small white flowers that can get to be the size of your head. It is the largest plant in the carrot family.",1300.0

"Gasking asserted that the creation of the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist",1100.0

The guy just books it after that. I feel the facial expressions in the game are done so damn well that it makes dialogue in this game really fun and intriguing.

"Health injector is the most usefull back pack item by far imo. Cloak is kinda meh but still far from the worst.
As far as armor goes going just above 200 or just above 220 is probably your best bet.
You could go for a spead build aswell if that suits your play style, but imo they are slightly under powered.
Get a helmet with 9.3 HRV recharge rate.
Armor isn't really important (it only applies to head shots, so if for example someone shoots you in the head with a 50 damage AR and you have a helmet with 6% armor the shot will deal 6% less damage, so in this case 94 instead of 100 damage).

SMG is the most OP weapon right now. M4X, HAR and AR are also good.
When building weapons go for accuracy first, then damage and recoil last.

"federal system is something you form with another state or independent entity. for example in the US several states chose to join and form a federal union. for turkey to become a federal country, it would first have to voluntarily or by force be split up into several independent entities. then they sit down and decide if the independent entities even want to form a federal union. during the negotiations we would decide federal powers vs. state powers and many other details that must first be agreed upon.

it would make more sense for us to form a federal union with azerbaijan, since two independent states already exist all we have to do is put through a serious effort by both governments. this is the only possible way turkey could become a federal country. we can form federal union with many of central asian nations as well. however breaking turkey up to form a ""federal country"" would be a bloody affair, no turk would agree to it voluntarily.",1100.0
"My fourth grade teacher, simply because she believed the best way to teach was through hands on experiences rather than lectures. We went on over 40 field trips that year, and I had some of the most amazing experiences because of her (we went to a rock and fossil show once, and it's what started my passion for archaeology). Even a lot of the lessons we did in class were a lot more hands on, we made paper by hand, wove our own baskets, and learned about history when she'd have everyone try on costumes of that era and give us all roles.

Funnily enough, the school actually shut it down the year after, when I was in 5th, so you could only take two field trips a year, and I'm almost positive it was because of my teacher in fourth.",1247.46176

One example I like is the house from Up. I suppose you could argue that it's obvious, but I didn't think much of it when I first saw the film; I mean, it was kinda overshadowed by the heart within the story itself. But when one understands that the house is representative of Ellie--how he cherishes and protects it despite it weighing him down for the entire film, and finally letting it go at the end only for it to land exactly as intended--that really added to the film for me.

After the crash of 2008, Yamaha responded with a cheap lineup of new bikes designed only to undercut pricing, then bought off the media to promote the bikes. No one gets invited to press junkets in Mallorca if they don't play nice with Yamaha.   Where the truth appears is years later when they refer back to older bikes with comments that contradict their own conclusions.
So the lesson is ignore the media, test ride the bikes and come to one's own conclusions. There is no unbiased media. This is especially true in US magazines, some British media still call a turd a turd.",1274.89754

video games, particularly mobas and RTS, are insanely popular and culturally acceptable there so everyone plays the game. everyone lives at max an area the size of michigan away (probably even smaller than that) so recruiting and finding talent is extremely easy. how is the states and europe supposed to compete with that?

its not out of possibility that they can take games off koreans, but if fnatic and origen (who are probably the 2 best western teams of all time) getting 3-0'd wasnt proof enough, then idk what will. korea is just better. and we have to accept that. it has nothing to do with thinking. its just a fact. we can take games off them, but come worlds, korea comes out to play. there will always be 1 godlike team out of korea that no one can hope to beat.

"Sorry for the slowish response but my thoughts:

Eat eggs for breakfast, if you like them. They fill you up, are easy to make, and have so many options. Pancakes are pretty meh because they're very carb heavy with little protein so you'll get hungrier earlier. 

Lunch is decent because peanut butter is good. BUT, imagine if you made a sandwich with peanut butter and banana slices instead of jelly (its really good, I promise)!

Dinner is reasonable. 

Overall I'd just eat more protein. Cheese sticks are an okay snack, I tend to eat them with my lunch. They're a little fat dense, but have a reasonable amount of protein so they would fill you up better than goldfish. Fruit is also good so grapes, apples, bananas etc. I'd cut out the pretzels and goldfish, or add peanut butter.",1289.725268

"You really think previous generations were somehow more responsible with their incomes than the current generations? The fact is costs on everything have gone up and wages haven't. Even if you want to save, you often don't have enough left over at the end of the month to put it away. In fact, most people living frugally go deeper in debt month to month, and it has nothing to do with living beyond their means. 

Ultimately your comment about responsibility means absolutely nothing. You must have no idea how inflation and institutional debt slavery have impoverished millions of ""responsible"" people trying to make their way in this country. And forget about having a family, just the hospital costs alone will put you in debt for years.

"This is clever on multiple levels. Mostly because just like everywhere else, the ones pushing the anti-white messaging are Jewish. Just another huge coincidence! 

Wouldn't it be funny if the media and political censorship resulted in a Swedish Spring uprising, and a bunch of European reporters got gang raped in the middle of the protest by the same Muslims who gang raped the ones in Egypt? 

How exactly would the chosen ones spin white European reporters being gang raped by Muslims in the center of Stockholm or Berlin? 

The absolute absurdity being created by the blind suppression of reality is truly leading to some hilarious results. 

I'm kinda looking forward to the first public sodomy of an anti white female reporter by one of their pets.

- the employer requested that he sets up a yahoo messenger account
- yahoo messenger was a program installed on his PC by the company
- he used it for both work and personal 
- when asked by the company he said it was only used for work
- the company intercepted his comms and later look on his PC (i think)

because he said that it was only for work purposes this is why there was not a breach of his rights when the employer accessed it. The court put allot of weight on this fact. The court viewed his yahoo messenger the same as his work email.

Because when i had to do mine it cost me 350(new pilot bearing new flywheel, clutch disc pressue plate,slave cylider which is internal by the way, and a new throw out bearing) and took 18 hours(i had never done one before.

"You gave up your 6 in the first 10 seconds of the fight. If he's coming at your 1 o'clock, turn into him, not away. Head to head you have the option depending on what you're trying to do. Turn into eachother and it will be a longer range secondary merge which is better for getting a missile off. If you're trying to avoid that, turn in the same direction as your enemy (if he's left of your nose and turns into you after the merge, you turn to the right), as it will make a smaller circle and it will become more of a knife fight.

In WWII birds you have to be extra careful about your energy management. Usually you want to gain altitude in the initial merge.

What are you doing with him during the day? No dog is going to want to sleep if they're not tired. Make sure you're tiring him out by doing plenty of activities during the day. 

&gt; How can I stop the yelping for attention? 

How have you gone about crate training? Does he think the crate is a fun place? Will he go in on his own? He may not just be yelping for attention, he may be yelping because he's stressed and uncomfortable in his crate. 

&gt; And how the hell do I stop the biting?

The first time in a play session that my puppy bites, I give her the benefit of the doubt and replace my hand with a toy. If she ignores the toy and still goes after me, all play stops. You just have to be consistent. If your mom and sister aren't being consistent with the biting, that's why she's still biting. ",1300.0

By this point I was well and truly hooked on Benzos and would completely lose control of how much I was taking. Week long blackouts, bags of valium gone, waking up in hospital (handcuffed to the bed), waking up in a police cell, waking up with a broken nose - completely covered in dried blood and my own shit (classy I know), losing my job, losing my place at Uni, my girlfriend and alienating myself from everyone around me.

While there was indeed some lawlessness following Hurricane Katrina, as well as frustration and anger, we can find little documentation of panic in the aftermath (emphasis) of the storm, which effected millions of Gulf Coast residents. 

In short, the vast majority of those who were prepared for that foreseeable disaster (a hurricane on the Gulf Coast) survived the event without serious personal harm. Property damage yes, but personal harm thankfully not for the majority. 

We believe therein lies the lesson for those of us in The Golden State: to be ready for foreseeable events, like a major earthquake. Being *personally prepared* for that inevitability will help us survive nearly any other problem that man or nature can throw our way :)

Another issue that this flag would disallow you from integrating with other TypeScript code that ever used the bracket-style syntax.

&gt; Are there any strategies that TypeScript uses or would consider adopting to help determine if a feature is worth adding, or worth breaking compatibility for?

As with most decisions, [it depends](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ItDepends). Most of our decisions are driven out of pragmatism. Right now, I can't see a reason why we would make this change. Everyone using JSX in TypeScript is already using `.tsx`, so why would we break existing code if creating a `.tsx` file is no harder than creating a `.ts`?",1100.0

"Proximity radars have existed for many years and they would functionally solve 99% of what you ask for as long as they can indicate HP values - which I'm sure would be a fairly easy addition to code. I don't honestly know how hard it would be to code frontal spells since it has quite a few more parameters than just distance between you and target (i.e. direction you face, a specific cone/box area etc), but I guess it would be quite simple to just code an opaque box to go over the radar indicating where your spell would land, without it going through the process of calculating how many people it would hit, the amount healed (particularly with the paladin mastery), etc. 

In any case, if you haven't tried your best bet is probably to just try to hit up someone who's made something like this before directly. Depending how complex you want this to be you'll probably find someone up for it.

Not only has the mastering of shale oil upended Hubbert’s theory about the peaking of US production, but the current shakeout in prices has significantly brought down drilling costs, too. So oil prices could be lower than they had been for a long, long time. Other factors could step in and create the same impact, though. Famously, the Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones, and oil could enter an autumn because tastes change: a combination of climate change rules, a consumer turn to electric cars, and simply less driving could all combine to much-reduce oil consumption. Some analysts think that is one reason why Saudi Arabia is so eager to pump at full tilt—to monetize its oil now, and let others leave their oil in the ground once demand plunges."" -/u/Steve_LeVine",1100.0

"It might have been Milner instead of Can, my memory isn't perfect on that.

That said, with or without Allen, it puts a mountain of responsibility on Can to drive play in transitions. If you take away one of his outlets and replace it with a player who doesn't quickly move play forwards then it makes his job even harder.

If we want to really control the tempo of the game and prevent it from becoming open then Allen's a great choice.  You're right about him, he's really good at what he does, but he's also a limited player who won't work well in certain styles and that's not really a knock again him.  Klopp loves his fast transitions and counters though so it's tough to see him being particularly effective in there if we're going to pursue that type of strategy for this game.",1276.09606

"I do think that sci fi has had an undeniable low period recently, especially in television. This isn't entirely the Syfy channels fault. Yes, their weak offerings didn't help but also the influx of superhero movies and TV spin offs also left sci fi and space operas down the pecking order in terms of what TV networks wanted. Movies like Sharknado are harmless to the genre and can be fun from time to time so I don't think that had much of an impact on sci fi as it did in popular culture. The good news is the Syfy has some wonderful new shows that go back to their roots and The Expanse is definitely leading the way. Also with the mother of all space operas getting a new movie every year, networks will start to look at sci fi and space operas soon enough. ",1286.26138

"As far as sharpness goes, you never really know till you get the knife. There might be reviews that indicate what to expect, but it still varies because knives are usually hand-sharpened at the factory. For example, I have a $30 Buck Nobleman that came with a wicked edge, and a $200 Benchmade that came much duller. 

Learning to sharpen your knives is practically required for this reason, and also so they will last you a long time. There are cheap guided systems that make it foolproof. Pretty much any knife should last you if you keep it sharp, clean, and oiled occasionally.

As far as carrying it or concealing it, check your local laws first. I think probably the most common type and method of carrying is a folder clipped to the pocket. But people also carry in belt sheaths of various kinds, or just in the pocket, or in ""knife slips"", or sometimes worn on a chain as a ""neck knife"".

It's an amazing achievement for a network show that has to run 20+ episodes a season.

That said, since the midpoint of Season 7, the show has taken a notable downturn. It's still a very good show but it's clear they're running out of ideas. The exit of Khalinda was clumsy at best and the political stories have been uninspired.

"They were just escaping the responsibilities. In the movie Tyler threaten to kill a guy if he don't start studying to get a degree.
Your friends just superficially understood the ideology of Tyler.

Tyler wanted to give purpose to the people and from what I understand his method was that most of us are internally/spiritually depressed and to cure them he have to put external depression, pain, cause, stress or purpose. 

The main reason cold showers, noFap... are awesome is not because of the so called superpowers you are promised about, its the feeling that if you can endure this, then you can also endure the less stressful things in your life. Why leave the comfort of watching porn to get the sexual stimulation whenever you want plus you don't want to deal with the complications of handling feelings and relationship, the porn will just give you joy and will not ask anything in return. Why leave it? Because deep inside we are depressed, which can only be cured through Tyler methods.

"I'm currently enjoying a WIP fanfiction called [A Marauder's Plan](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan). The basic plot summary is that Sirius sticks around after fleeing Hogwarts and makes Harry his #1 priority. Things snowball from there and while the Triwizard Tournament is still a thing, the circumstances surrounding Harry on a personal level have changed and the obstacles in his way are completely different.

The writing is very good, and each chapter has a purpose, but what really sticks out to me about it is how every so often we get treated to a scene from another character's point of view.

Memphis' scheme I would compare more to Oregon. Yes, there is a ton of schemed production, especially with screen passes, but they also rely more on the QB to find open WRs on other passing concepts, and not simple timing throws like Cal rely on.

They also run some plays that are very difficult for the quarterback. Lynch is amazing on comeback throws and rollouts. He also has a great deep ball, and is way more poised than Goff when plays go off schedule. He's also great at putting the ball where only the receiver can get it in one-on-one's on the outside.

I know you're salty, but you can't be serious with this.  Plenty of people both play and enjoy Rift, and they're doing a pretty natural rotation of the 6v6 game types.  Even though I'd prefer Control, I'd be saltier if they never had Rift in the rotation.

""Evidence of a total lack of judgement""?  You say that, but I'm not seeing any actual evidence.

"Don't much about Chief beyond the video games and info on the sub ( I read Fall of Reach a loooong time ago) so take everything with a grain of salt.

1. I think Wolverine loses. Except for a few showings, Wolverine seemed much weaker without his healing factor. The loss of his HF seemed to affect his confidence and abilities, and he generally got slapped around a lot more. He was also pretty reluctant to pop his claws, and I'm not sure that his armor's claws could pierce Chief's armor. Finally, even if the armor is bullet proof, Chief should be strong and fast enough to put the hurt on Logan

2. /u/Maggruber, how powerful are Chief's energy shields? I heard they're pretty nerfed in the games. IMO they could be a pretty big factor in the fight, as Wolverine's claws [can't pierce energy fields](http://i.imgur.com/vpT09RY.png).

"This isn't true. There is an energy loss with transporting electricity. I'm not disputing that. But, the net amount of fuel that can be transported must take in to account the fuel that is used to transport it ie. diesel fuel in a semi tanker carrying fuel. Also it's possible that the power grid could be adapted to a different model. Where the power generation is  less centralized. Each neighborhood could have its own power generation  which would cut out the power loss of long range transmission. Imagine you have an electric car. You drive to work where you can charge it. You drive back home, and use your car to charge and power bank in your home. If the generation of electricity is clean, and cheap enough it the efficiency of its use isn't as important imo. Also the power loss of electricity transmission of the US annually is around 6%. That's quite small compared to the 25% efficiency of the average car. ",1283.9848

If you've ever soloed missions, you'd notice this too. For instance, on Illuminate Helldives there is always like 5-6 Hunters that initially spawn off-screen. Scouts can respawn in front of you if you happen to kill enough scout units without setting off alarms, same goes for Hounds.

There's also a solo Bug boss video somewhere where the guy used a SH-20 with static fields and he never killed the Bug Elites (upgraded soldiers) so there were always five and he could focus on the Boss itself.

The T-60 is aruguebly the M1A2.

All the special modifcations such as targeting finders and such as basically addons similar to reactive armor and turrent modifications (IE adding 40mm mg instead of the M2 browning or reactive armor).

Ihminen oppii kokemuksen myötä. Jos tehtävät eivät muutu ja persoona on rutinoituvaa sorttia ei välttämättä opi ikinä mitään. Toisaalta joku samassa positiossa voi innovoida ties mitä kun näkee tiettyjä ongelmia läheltä ja keksii niihin ratkaisuja. 

Jotkut taas odottavat, että yritys kouluttaa jopa hyvinkin erilaisiin tehtäviin. En ole itse varma onko yritysten rooli toimia kouluina. Monet yritykset tietysti toimivat, koska näkevät sen järkevänä. Mutta onko se asia, johon yritykset pitää pakottaa laeilla? Mitä tämä tarkoittaa kilpailukyvyn kannalta jos verrataan tilannetta maihin, jossa yrityksiä ei pakoteta kouluttamaan henkilöstöä uusiin tehtäviin jos vanhat loppuvat?",1100.0

"Dwarf Fortress is a fantastic piece of work in many respects, but I think it serves as an illustration that this type of work just isn't viable in the for-profit, AAA sphere. DF is a labor of love and madness, and it's also coming up on 14 years of development (8 of those post-release.) Beyond that, the AAA gurus would also have to convince their bread-and-butter customer base to accept a much higher learning curve, comparatively primitive graphics, and no voice acting to speak of.

Adventure mode is a pretty astounding leap forward though. Prior to  its release, one also could've argued that the differing player perspective in DF and a game like Fallout 4 really put a microscope over the latter's player/NPC interactions, whereas DF could get away with abstraction due to distance. But Adventure Mode changes the conversation. I'm always excited to see where DF is going to go next.",1267.074872

"&gt; Be the player you want to d m. In 1976, players vastly outnumbered refs. In 2016, it's the reverse. Good players are highly valued, and you should expect them to be committed to other groups, so join some groups and network.

Depends on where you are. Locally we've had up to four GM's at the FLGS and easily over 24 players at a time. When one of the GM's dropped out due to work there was a PF group that had over a dozen players running.

The biggest issue I've found isn't getting players - it is location and scheduling. I run a PF game that has a core of about 6 players with more that drop in and out, but another game I run has just 2 players. 

The PF game is run at above mentioned FLGS after normal work hours, and the other is run out of my house during the weekend. Getting players to drive and give up part of the weekend (or give up another established game, etc) is the hurdle.

I refrain from calling myself ""gay"" because it is a more secular way to describe someone than ""SSA"". In a Catholic context as on this forum, I feel the latter is more appropriate.

You can't fix your parents situation, but you can fix your own.

Talk to a teacher and ask them if there are any tutors for classes that you're struggling in. Show them you care about your grades. As you get to know your tutor, ask him/her about kids in school.

Are there any clubs you could join to meet with other kids? Service organizations (like Beta Club) are a good way to connect with others.

"I don't know exactly how the Boots creme works, but ideally you'll want a styling product that forms a 'gel cast' that gets crunchy and hard as it dries. I like to think of it as a cocoon for your curls. When the gel hardens, its providing protection, sealing out frizz and sealing in moisture while preventing outside elements from damaging it.

Once your hair is *completely dry*, 'scrunch the crunch' and the gel disappears, leaving your hair curly and smooth. Frizz happens when you're messing with your hair between the wet and dry stages, so its important to apply all of your product to wet hair first, then try your very hardest not to touch!

"Rubio would be absolutely crushed by Clinton. He is one of those candidates that seems good on paper, but in practice he exudes inexperience and nervousness; imagine Barack Obama if he had no confidence in what he was saying. Not to mention he is also an empty suit that is completely beholden to his donors. He just would not be able to out-establishment Clinton, and would likely drive away minority voters rather than attract them; being Cuban is a huge turn-off to Hispanic voters that aren't Cuban.

Against Sanders would be a tossup, but I really lack faith in Rubio's ability to control the media narrative or to not come off as severely overcompensating for his soft-spoken demeanor and babyfaced appearance. Overall, it is so weird to me that so many people think Rubio would do well in a general. From what I can see, the man is completely unelectable.",1279.58584

Yet ""futuristic"" might be a trap, because what if it's futuristic... with magic? And no science? The problem is futuristic and magic and such are not mutually exclusive categories, whereas science and magic are closer to being so (you could have both in one story, but it would be weird. Though Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality certainly does it as a core theme!)

Ideally, you'd want separate terms, like ""future fantasy"" and ""future scifi"" or ""contemporary fantasy"" ""contemporary scifi"" etc. But oh well.

"Что вы несете, какие еще националисты в ЦК КПУ?

Местные коммунисты на тот момент хотели создать себе заповедник коммунизма в Украине (что у них и вышло в той или иной степени), т.к. Ельцын начал щемить КПСС еще союзе.

Так что, никакого национализма, обычный инстинкт выживания, который случайно совпал с национальными интересами Украины.

This is where understanding the difference between a sole trader and ltd company will be important in making your decision about when to switch.

(warning, layperson advice)

With a limited company, the *company* is on the hook for most any penalties. As a sole trader, it'd be *you*. So if something happens and you owe a whack of money, it's really *you*. So your savings, house, etc are all possibly on the line.

"It's said that perception of a shock starts at .001 Amps (1 mA)

At .01A (10 mA), your muscle reflex could make it so you can't relax your muscle/let go.  If you've seen an electrocution video and the body just freezes, you've already observed this.  

At .1 A (100mA) you're looking at death, depending on the current path.  

As you said, it is about the amperage, but it's also about the path the current takes through the body.  Taking 100mA through your arm (like finger to elbow)is going to hurt, but it probably won't kill you.  If your working with your hands and you're standing up, the current could pass through your heart, leading to atrial fibrillation (irregular heart beat/loss of heart beat).  

This is getting quite in depth, but natural body resistance is quite variable.  Voltages much less than 120V can kill you.  Industrial standards put the definition of [LOW VOLTAGE (CLICKY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage) at 50 Volts.

"Nobody said we are doing nothing out of fear. The only people acting scared, are the ones calling to bomb the place to bits.

Whether or not we could be blamed for the mess, our involvement encourages the people living in the war to be confused and unable to identify who their aggressors are. Being jaded, they are just looking for more reasons why we are the problem. Rather than have a considered approach, people that are cautious are called terrorists sympathisers, or social justice plebs, and the response is always reactionary. 

After Paris, the UK government voted on whether or not we should send our troops to Syria. Whilst the debate questioned the proposed plan, not amendments or changes were acknowledged in the concern that our actions make terrorism here more likely. Whilst the debate failed to address any of the real concerns, the press were busy making fun of what people said and failed convey any details or measured concerns about our response. ",1293.99288

In the end we both made it to 4 solid days without a single lick of rest. Mid-afternoon my brother ended up passing out in bed and not too soon after he did I was out cold as well.

"I'm not sure that's really the right phrasing of the question anyway. Outside of some true ZPGs most incrementals have a significant 'manual' phase at every stage of the game. I think that too few games appropriately acknowledge this, really. 

Buying upgrades or rebuying buildings or whatever the basic 'improvement' mechanic is usually ends up being very click intensive and in a game with prestige mechanics can easily outweigh the time spent clicking to 'build up' to the automatic portion.

In general, all gameplay is 'manual,' and trying to distinguish between interesting clicks and uninteresting ones isn't necessarily productive. If there's a question of 'how much drudgery/uninteresting or repetitive play should my game have?' then 'none' is an easy answer whether it's the period before the main gameplay starts or rebuying your upgrades and buildings for the 100th time.",1100.0

Fallingwater was built between 1936 and 1939.  It instantly became famous, and today it is a National Historic Landmark.

"I think Firmino suffers from a couple of things at the moment. Firstly, I think he's having a crisis of confidence in terms of shooting, I think he needs to bag a good one or two solid strikes to get that confidence back. The other problem is I think he can be too casual at moments in games (I don't know how it is in Germany, but here in England there isn't really a moment you can afford to fall asleep), his passes are often too soft and get cut out too easily, or his runs off the ball come too late or are not quick enough. The funny thing about this is that at times he has bursts of energy where his passes will be more punchy and his runs will be smart and quick. I kinda think he's due a little Klopp slap to kinda wake him up a bit.

Quality player though, you can see that, but he needs a run of games in that position I think, some luck and his confidence will be back.",1274.23426

"The noctua air coolers match the performance of the h100. You can also look at the h110 which slightly outperforms the air. The difference is they are tiny. With a liquid cooler you won't have to worry about a massive heat sink blocking your ram. Also, liquid cooling cools your cpu down after it's been under load alot faster than air. So they are superior is some aspects. I personally would go liquid cooling in your situation just because they are quiet and pain free and won't be in the way of your ram. You can get any type of ram you want and it will NEVER obstruct the ram. So it's great for future upgrades also. But if you want to get new ram you can do that too, but personally I'd keep the ram and go liquid. ",1258.36372

Look for something more concrete in the future, but rest assured we value both the input we've received and our  current Vintage and Legacy communities."" 

Whoever was responsible for its core content, the response veered from absurd (""proxies are a form of counterfeiting"") to patronizing (framing it as wanting stores to ""protect Magic experiences"") to outright unsympathetic (""We know players love Magic and love playing its variety of formats, including Vintage and Legacy. Some formats are easier to get into than others and these two are hard.)

Single car accident on a country road wherein he fractured/smashed in most of his front left temporal lobe area. He's pretty sure he was ejected from his car during the crash and that is why he lived. The car - a jeep - was crushed so small from rolling that he's positive he would not have survived had he been belted in. We can't be sure because he lay unfound for about 12 hours in scrub and was discovered walking along a road in a daze by a friend after that. He has no recollection of any of it. 

He still only wears a seatbelt grudgingly - mainly when he is in my car which beeps at him until he puts it on. He's quite smart but also a fucking idiot. ",1268.240928

"This was indeed and excellent post, from a person and mind that has undoubtedly learned much from their Vipassana experience, even if they have not fully realised, or understood yet. 

I can't answer the questions you have, but I can only give my own experience of Vipassana courses. I have completed one long and one short.

I found within my practice that sensation in body during meditation and wandering of mind were inextricably linked. When I made this correlation, I became aware of the deep seated relationship between body and mind. Issues within mind are issues with body, issues with body surface as issues in mind. 

I think perhaps look deeper into why sensations arose, and how they dissipated - the state of your mind at these times.

I found that recurring sensations were actually recurring thoughts that needed to be worked through, both physically and mentally. Perhaps I am incorrect in this summation, I am not sure. 

Hope that helps in some way. ",1272.259426

"I was in a similar situation late last year.  I was leaning towards a 6 sport MT, and ultimately decided on a 3 sGT MT (hatch) for a few reasons.

* There are not many 6 MTs in my area (the ones that are around commanded a higher price just because they could)
* The low end 6 MTs do not have Mazda Connect (no reverse cam, no touch screen, etc.) making the 6 sport MT less of a deal
* As a sedan, I liked the 6 better than the 3.  The hatch is the reason I got the 3 (may not apply to you)
* Price/Value wise, the 3 was a better deal for me.

I've had my 3 for a little over a month now, and love it.  I'm glad I chose the 3 sGT MT over the 6.",1100.0
