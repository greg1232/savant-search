"Cynicism, in its classical sense, bore marked similarities to MGTOW. The Cynics believed that the most important thing was to live a life of virtue. Virtue came from repudiating ignorance, folly, conceit, and mindlessness. They believed in the primacy of human reason and criticized social mores and customs that others took for granted. The practiced parrhesia, the ability to speak candidly, rather than the more formalistic and manipulative discipline of rhetoric. The Cynics practiced varying degrees of asceticism, mental and physical discipline to attain self-sufficiency. Zeno of Citium incorporated Cynicism into Stoicism, the most famous adherent of which was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

A much lower-powered Spurs put 2 past Watford and Arsenal and Man United have traveled there and scored multiple goals as well, so  there's nothing historically that says City can't do the same besides their form as of late.

Even prior, and occasionally at much worse exchange rates, I preferred to invest in US equities simply because the universe of investing opportunities in the US is vastly superior and more diverse.

CAD could perhaps appreciate vs. USD at some future time when the Canadian economy eventually improves or some economic malaise strikes the US but I wouldn't be hugely worried because I still prefer to invest in the US and I have many decades ahead of me to cash in my US dollars, during which time I'm sure we'll see more occasions of favorable rates like these ones.",1270.7772

&gt; Khalil Fong (方大同, born July 14, 1983) is an soul/R&amp;B singer and songwriter from Hong Kong. He was born in Hawaii and his family moved to Shanghai when he was 6. His father (an American-born Chinese from San Francisco, California) wanted Khalil to learn more about Chinese culture. 6 years later, they moved to Guangzhou and lived for about 2 years. Afterwards, they moved to Hong Kong. When he was 16, he sent demos, which he had written, to music producers. (He was most interested in Warner Music Group.) 4 years later, Warner Music Hong Kong finally recruited him as a new rising star of 2005.

"The goal of the game isn't to ""trick the sheriff the most by sneaking things in"" (which wouldn't have been what he was doing anyway if he was declaring chickens each time, anyway, since if your declaration is honest you aren't sneaking anything).. it is to have the most gold at the end. Besides that, you are just as likely to trick the sheriff with a new hand of cards as you are re-using old ones. In fact, more so, since the sheriff who notices you picking up the chickens you got through last round is going to be pretty sure you're just sending them through again.

I understand what he was doing is against the rules, but I am having trouble fathoming why anyone would have wanted to do this even if it *was* allowed by the rules :P

"&gt; Im level 19 and i only lack 6 cards

Bloody hell I hate seeing this mentioned.

You only have so many cards because you signed up early on in the beta and got duplicate defaults issued when the free starter cards got changed and all those cards that are now legendary and specialty used to be rares and epics.

In its current state for a newcomer, you have basically none of the good builds. And because there are so many junk legendaries and specialties, it'll be a while before you can get the one you want, even assuming you always get duplicates on your path to upgrade tiers.

And no, you really cannot win 4v5. The way damage compares to HP doesn't allow it.",1269.09095

"For a budget deck, it's actually pretty strong. This game mostly runs on mana rather than cards, as a resource, so 0 mana cards can create very nice tempo swings.


The thing about budget decks is they don't have these 2in1 and 3in1 cards like Makantor Warbeast, so you'll rely on having many small and midrange minions and eventually making a Fortitude/Diretide Frenzy play with them in order to win the board. Perhaps you can rush out a tiger with Frenzy as well. And having that unit stay alive afterwards, or at full health thanks to the Dampening Wave can be really nice, especially since it doesn't cost any mana.

It's also nice to be able to hit it with your general without spending hp, if you lack 2 damage to kill a big thing. Or even use it in combination with Adamantite Claws to save some hp and an artifact charge. I think the spell is reasonably versatile to be ran as a 2-of (or maybe 1 of if deck space is a problem) in budget decks.",1100.0

I was depressed several years ago, drugs and therapy didn't help, and I ended up dealing with it on my own.

The answers would always start out as very surface level, but they'd get deeper and eventually I'd arrive at something unexpected, some truth about myself I never wanted to admit.

LotRO is an MMORPG that takes the Roleplay part of RPG seriously. There are tons of emotes, little interactions (being able to sit on a chair by going /sit near one), player housing, outfit slots for appearance independent from gear etc.

It really feels like it was created by LotR fans for LotR fans, not just a generic MMO with a LotR flair. The classes make sense inside the universe (no mages spamming fireballs and arcane energy flashes, no magical healing abilities), the ability to meet all the characters from the books and visit all the places the fellowship has visited, or the far away ones you only hear of (Angmar for example). 

It's a grand MMO, might not be the best in terms of gameplay, mechanical depth or challenging and engaging content, but it's a blast for anyone who enjoys Lord of the Rings, or wants to immerse themself and roleplay.",1100.0

Wm on support actually I think stays wider and crosses from further up the pitch as wm-a is supposed to attack the goal directly.

"Because it hurts the one you're supposed to love.

Cheating is not about sex, it's about the violation of trust. If your wife is able to separate feelings and sex as well, then it's a non issue, she should be ok with you sleeping with other women as you should be ok with her sleeping with other men.

But if she can't, then you need to lie and deceive her to be able to have the extra marital sex you want. Now if she doesn't find out, hey no problem right? Well yeah, but you have to keep that lie going for decades, basically until you die. The longer the lie has been going on the more hurt there will be. So if you ever slip up, or one of the women you have slept with tell her it would be devastating. 

Think about how much pain your infidelity would put your wife through. This is the woman you love and have pledged your life to. Why would you do that to her just for a fuck? 

That being said, if you REALLY want to have sex with other women, you should have the discussion with your wife. ",1265.148688

"Legendary gems could help you a great deal in terms of power etc.
and the extracted powers in Kanai's cube.
Now i must say i dont know the WD, but i would check the ingame leaderboard and see what they equip.

Then its not just copy what you see and roll with it. Carefully read the description of the items and skills and try to understand WHY they chose that gem, or item or the skills on the items.  

You dont have to do the highest greater rift, with a key you can choose any level.
Just start lower, if you can do Torment 8 or 9, go with a level 30-35 rift, and try it out. see how quickly you beat it. if it feels to fast go higher, if you struggle go lower. At the same time level the gems and get a bit stronger each time you try.
  
in terms of ""doing something wrong"" as long as you're having fun playing the game and the build its all good.

"It's true that the President alone cannot arbitrarily nuke a country, they're just the top of the chain of command and give authorization when a launch recommendation is made, but to think that person could have been Sarah Palin is the stuff of nightmares.

The reason for the codes is to allow for a final sober thought before letting the nukes fly. Sarah Palin, no doubt, wouldn't hesitate to launch if it involved the Russians or Chinese, no matter how suspicious the circumstances were.

**Worst car I've driven:**

Probably a tie between the F150 or the Corolla. Everything in the F150 felt super spongy and float-y, and everything in the Corolla felt like it was going to break apart at any second.

"That may well be correct, but my current operating theory is that the obsessios are just counters to the wards.  These counters then have counters, which have counters and so on.  Only when one side runs out of time and space or messes up does the fight end.  So either player can win, whether he or she entered in a ward or responded with obsessio.  And the start positions are essentially neutral.  They only have plus or minus value in context of what the other person does in response.   Then some positions offer more options than the others.

"&gt;6 ÷ 2(1+2) = ?

The correct answer is: 6 / 2 \* (3) = 3 \* 3 = 9.

Unless you're assuming justified multiplication tags along and counts as a single parameter, in which case you get 6/(2\*3) which would be 6/6 = 1.

Given that we're clearly using parentheses, and thus should group accordingly, the proper answer would indeed be 9. The division symbol, like the implied multiplication symbol, only takes two parameters. The full equation being: (6/2)\*(1+2) which indeed is 3\*3=9.

Basically, unless you're an idiot, the correct answer to that question is 9, because we don't assume shit that isn't there.",1247.230672

"/u/simplytaxing is correct about the coverage gap but incomplete about the income based exemptions.  See the instructions for Form 8965 for a worksheet to calculate the affordability on a per month basis.

It does use the annual income but the affordability can vary per month. It also matters how many people in your household and your location.  Also check exemption G it is basically another way to slice the same question.  I'm not saying you do or don't qualify but you should run the firm numbers before giving up.

"You don't know ANYONE that is happy about the larger screens? I got a Galaxy Note 3 a few years ago and it changed my view on phones. That was my first plus sized phone experience and after using it for a few months I could never go back. I was so excited when I heard Apple was making plus sized phones because it meant I could come back to Apple while keeping the screen size. I live off my phone for 80% of my day. Emailing, texting, reading PDF's, watching videos, everything is better on a larger phone I am so happy with my 6S+ and I could never use a phone with a screen smaller than 5.5"" again. People have different use cases. I think it's great that Apple is going to make a 4"" phone for those that want it, but don't pretend like everyone with a 6/6+ is a victim of Stockholm syndrome and has just grown to deal with it.

"I have lived out west my whole life, so take that into account as I share my opinion.

If you like Mountains, then Alberta and BC are the place to be. Big cities would be Calgary, Edmonton (further from the mountains) and Vancouver. If you aren't looking for big cities, the interior of British Columbia has tons of nice gems. The Okanagan region has great summers on the lake and mild winters.

Vancouver is expensive to live in and has rainy mild winters. Lots of people and job opportunities. If you don't mind living out of the city, cost of living gets more affordable towards the Fraser Valley (East) and you still enjoy the same great climate. It is still possible to commute to the city from out that way too.

I guess the real question is... what are you looking for in a place to live? ",1100.0

"Yeah I could understand the fear of retaliation. It sounds like an unfortunate situation all around.  I don't know the legality behind disposing of a dog that is killed on your property, but I would just bury it or dispose of the body and let the neighbors assume it ran away if there is a real concern of retaliation. It's not an ideal situation, but it seems like your neighbors aren't reasonable people.

If you can safely catch the dogs, you could start bringing them to your local shelter, many cities and municipalities will label dogs as nusiance or dangerous animals if they are allowed to roam free or keep getting out of their yard.

"A balanced federal budget is also a horrendously awful idea, opening up all kinds of problems, including but not limited to:  
  
1) Inability to deal with fiscal crises without sudden, massive austerity measures that put the economy into irrecoverable contraction  
2) Extortion by a political minority through manipulation of the budget (even worse than we have now)  
3) Intermittent loss of all aspects of the social safety net based on economic conditions, resulting in mass suffering, wild swings in consumer confidence, and damage to the economy  
4) Bank and pension fund failures would rapidly spin out of control  
5) Capital investment by the government would essentially be impossible

"&gt; I didn't ask for a source for the MWP. I asked for your evidence of ""much more warming... and much more rapidly"" ... than the MWP.

So you admit you didn't read the paper. The paper says exactly that. Much more warming and more rapidly today than during the MWP. 

Not only that, it's **the** paper that deniers fraudulently chop off the data from the end of the chart and then show as ""based on.""
The video details this and how in order to fake the point that the MWP was warmer than ""today"" the deniers have to mangle the original chart

"I feel the same way, but another thing we have to think about, if a new sequel was released it will be hard to make it go futuristic, without major changes.

Reasoning:
• It's ""Modern Warfare"", to keep it ""Modern"" the game can't be set too far out in the future, Ghosts timeframe is the farthest I believe they could go.
• Let's say they follow another trendy theory going around and continue the MW series but instead of calling it MW4 they call it Future Warfare. The name will be too similar to advanced warfare and wouldn't be well received with ""future"" lol.

It's honestly a crapshoot as to what this title will be, but since BF5 is releasing and those games tend to be as modern as they can be, IW would be smart to keep it in the same timeframe and not just release another futuristic game. Or just make everyone happy and fulfill their destiny of releasing the MW collection haha.",1253.985048

"Not a steamfitter, but a good pair of earplugs is da bomb. Start by heading to home depot or anywhere and looking for a couple pairs with the cord attaching them.

"A few things to note friend:

One in the current political environment money is required.

Two Bernie Sanders is mainly against Super PACs. Us donating is a PAC.  

 super PACs may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates. Unlike traditional PACs, super PACs are prohibited from donating money directly to political candidates, and their spending must not be coordinated with that of the candidates they benefit. Super PACs are required to report their donors to the Federal Election Commission on a monthly or semiannual basis – the super PAC's choice – in off-years, and monthly in the year of an election.

PACS have limits and they are from real people. Not corporations. They're from people who like what he has to say and donates 5 dollars. Not making shady backroom deals for millions.",1100.0

Prostate orgasm.

Assemble the cube and move it around, and tighten or loosen each face (all of them every time) by quarter-turns, so that you know the tensions are almost even, and from then on it's trial and error. Sometime if I feel one screw feels tighter I'll skip a quarter-turn on it and go on with the rest until the next round.

I never said that it's beautiful or talked about sexism, I said it's a non sexual action that is done to feed an infant, and should be viewed as such. I agree that it is a bodily function, but it is not unsanitary and distastefulness is again a subjective experience. 

Excuse oneself to where? There are no utilities for women to breastfeed in public areas that are widely used. Would you rather the mother let her kid cry from hunger just so your delicate sensibilities can be placated?

""Also, the freakonomists’ theory about the psychological causes of crime comes right out of “Gee, Officer Krupke,” when a gang member says of his parents, “They didn’t wanna have me, but somehow I was had. Leapin’ lizards! That’s why I’m so bad!” And it is about as plausible. Though unwanted children may grow up to commit more crimes, it is more likely that women in crime-prone environments have more unwanted children than that unwantedness causes criminal behavior directly. In studies that pit the effects of parenting against the effects of the children’s peer environment, holding genes constant, the peer environment almost always wins.""

"If starbucks says they are raising the price of their coffee... it sure as hell means consumers are paying more. 

Do you understand the conceptual difference between PST/GST and HST? 

Under PST/GST, Starbucks pays tax on every transaction of manufacturing, packaging, shipping, storage. When you purchase the item, you pay some additional tax on top of what the company passes along to you to cover their costs. This is called cascading, and products made in BC will have a higher price than things made outside BC because the companies producing the product keep having to pay tax at every step and increasing the price of the goods and services. 

Under HST, the company pays no tax, and passes along no tax. You pay the final price, and you pay the final tax. Products with more steps of production will have a lower end-price because they have no cumulative hidden costs added in.

"**Title:** Precise Jumps

**ID:** 6C65-0000-015E-65D7

**Bookmark:** https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/6C65-0000-015E-65D7

**Difficulty:** Super Expert

**Description:** This is the first level I have made (and just recently uploaded) that is inspired by my love of hard levels from this game and other games like super meat boy. It contains hard twirl jumps, spin jumps, and proper controlling of momentum and is pretty challenging in my opinion. I unfortunately do not have a capture card to have recorded how to beat it. I'd love for some people to try it out if they enjoy hard levels and tell me what they think!

ORD has no central lost and found. Items are collected and held by different entities depending on the location in which they were found.

Chicago Police - (773) 686-2385 | TSA - (773) 377-1210 | Food service locations - (773) 686-6148

If OP is open to it, it might not be the worst idea in a sense. She could make an appointment with a counselor/therapist, explain her issues and see if her sister could go together with her and the counselor would be willing to explain to the sister why they each need their own identities. It could help get her into someone and get a different perspective while also giving OP some support in relaying to her sister that she needs her space and individuality. Getting her to go with her on the premise of dealing with the issues around being less identical and their history might make her more open to the idea and push her a bit towards getting help, even if OP has no intention of continuing a relationship with her sister after.

It does have one big advantage over Mumble, and that is you don't need to have a server. But if you already have a Mumble server that's moot.

If I had to sum it up, I'd say that Discord does a better job of being an online ""hub"" for your gaming buddies, where Mumble is laser-focused on being voicechat and little else.

To answer your question, not to my knowledge. I am using only 1 monitor for the time being so I am really only able to observe my cpu/gpu usage if it were to freeze with MSI afterburner in view at that moment. Sometimes it freezes when using CPU/GPU intensive applications, other times I'm just browsing the internet, or in some circumstances I walk away for a moment and come back to a locked up system (no programs running). To clarify, when I say freeze it is a full system lockup that requires the power button to reboot, not just a temporary hang.

I have an old monitor that I will plug in when I get home from work for monitoring my CPU usage when it freezes.

EDIT: I am not 100% sure if I am even able to plug an ethernet cable into my mobo directly, I will have to check. I will eventually have to use a wifi adapter in the future since running an Ethernet cable the required distance to my modem permanently is not a possibility. ",1100.0

"You are confusing speed with energy. For a photon, since it is massless, its energy is proportional to its frequency and not its speed. High frequency photons (x-rays and gamma rays) do indeed rip apart atoms. For this reason, they are called ionizing radiation, and can be very damaging to living creatures and materials. Lower frequency photons (radio, infrared, visible light, some UV) do not have enough energy to rip apart atoms, even though they also travel at the speed of light, and are relatively safe. They just heat you up, i.e. cause electrons, atoms, and molecules that they hit to vibrate more quickly. 

Why would photons have infinite energy? They do not have mass, so you cannot use the relativistic mass expression for kinetic energy, if that is what you were thinking. ",1100.0

If this couple was so full of conviction, then why are they standing on a corner waiting for someone to take up their offer when there's plenty of adoption services available and children and babies who could use that sort of help right now.

You're giving a lot of credit to a sacrifice they haven't made yet when they're just standing there on the sidewalk with a sign.",1300.0

&gt; About 70 percent said they got their guns from family, fellow gang members or through other social connections. Only two said they bought a gun at a store.

If you click through to the study, the criminals state flat out that they'll have a girlfriend get a FOID (which is a requirement to purchase ammo, much less a firearm in IL), buy whatever they want, and then she'll report the guns as stolen.

What do you propose, then? There are only so many servers, so many players and so many variables affecting the connections at any given time.

&gt;And them having terrible games makes them feel worse, and is more likely to cause them to quit the game completely causing a loss to the games population.

Some of us don't care. We're so used to being dead weight that we expect to do badly. Yet it is quite clear from this very subreddit that the ones who have 1.5+ K/Ds *do* care.

"Nope, motorcycles are unique in that aspect.

Its really something that can't be explained and needs to be experienced. 

You either get it, or you don't.

Also, to get the amount of acceleration my $5k motorcycle gets, I would have to spend at the least, north of $100k. And then you don't get the fun of straddling the engine and the pure, kinetic energy running over you. Because riding a motorcycle is more like, a partnership between you and the bike, you push it too far, and it gives out on you, don't push it enough, and it won't do what you want. You have to manipulate your whole body to ride it. Its said the only thing more complicated to pilot than a motorcycle is a helicopter, but it all becomes so intuitive....

"When I was 15 or 16 I was on the bus with two friends. One is very tall and slim, the other is super petite.

It was coming close to winter so we were talking about boots we'd seen that we liked. One of my friends said how difficult it is to find boots that don't leave a gap (between her leg and the boot), my other friend agreed.

I sarcastically said ""oh, you poor things, your legs are so slim, that must be so hard for you both""

One of them shot me this look and said ""oh shut up, curvy and pretty""

I know everyone says (especially to teenage girls) that everyone is insecure about different things blah blah, but until my friend said that I hadn't really seen it in action, and it was kind of, reassuring. 

I've kinda kept it with me as a reminder not to compare myself to other women, we all have things we'd like to change, but we also have things other people envy, so there's no point getting worked up about it.",1264.9911

"Thanks for such a detailed response! I understand what you are trying to say.

The reason I asked this question was because I was watching Ryan Hall's defensive guard series and he mentioned how one should always have a long distance guard, a medium distance guard and a close range guard so that you use the appropriate tool for the right situation. His analogy was not throwing away the gun (the longer distance guard) and going straight to the knife (the close range guard)

But I think I see what you mean. Marcelo seemingly ignores long distance guard work for a middle to close distance guard like seated guard but this is compensated by the increase in mobility, ""not taking himself out of position"" as you said. This allows him to scoot in and out and move into more dominant positions like SLX.",1100.0

"Ha! I WISH fruits were zero calories. I love me just about all of the fruits on this list (pineapple, berries, apples, etc) but when I started doing a 1200 cal diet with specific macro goals in mind (in my case low-ish carb and low sugar, high protein and moderate fat) I had to cut fruit down to one serving per day, usually something lower sugar/carb like berries. Eating tons of fruit just gave me way, way too much sugar (yes.. it's natural sugar combined with fiber which slows the absorption and has some vitamins etc but it's still sugar and still possible to over-eat or over do it on fruit). Veggies on the other hand it's very, very hard to over-eat on most of them but that doesn't mean they are negative calories. I've heard this myth a lot though.. negative calorie foods, starvation mode and weird stuff about ""cleanses,"" ""toxins,"" ""detox,"" etc are some of the most pervasive mis-understandings about nutrition and weight loss that my friends and family seem to hold, and often bring up.",1100.0

"So I've discovered I love Floid Amber &amp; Blue aftershaves recently, and want to get my hands on one of the nice 400ml bottles.

TVB Shaving has a great deal on them, but the shipping is 54 Euro so I was thinking of organizing a group buy for them. If there are enough interested parties, I'll go ahead with the order. To make it worthwhile, we'd want to have 10+ bottles to make the shipping worthwhile.

They also sell colour matched atomizers, so if you'd want to get one with yours, please specify here.

I'm based in Toronto, Canada so preferably open to Canadians so we don't have to deal with shipping alcohol based aftershaves.

Hope this isn't breaking any rules; I've been on all of the wet shaving subs for a little while now, and have had 4 (working on the 5th &amp; 6th as we speak). Happy to provide my ebay account or any other way to prove my trustworthiness.

"&gt;&gt;African-Americans have an infant mortality rate of 11.1. Were they a country they would rank ca #100, well below Botswana, Sri Lanka, Libya.

&gt;&gt;In social studies infant mortality is the most important indicator. If that rate is low you know they're gonna have a shitty life, to put it in layman's terms. It means the country has little focus on even the most weakest and most innocent. Furthermore, if they start of on such a bad footing then there is little grounds for believing the formative childhood years will be positive, leading to low chance of success as an adult.

&gt;Yea, that is some cherry picked statistics that could equally be used to say African American mothers don't take care of themselves

A way to make sure you choose the right girl is to research. Read all of her reviews. Read her website. Find out of she posts on GFE/escorting message boards and see how she interacts with guys. 

I don't know where you are, but here in NJ we have 2 popular GFE/Escort forums and a lot of the girls interact daily with the guys on various chat forums. The guys can get to know them a  little first.

I think there is more to it than what you write.

For a 500% SBB I get 987% for B and 932% for O (904% for G).
That 10% extra atk stat is multiplying the SBB too. Not to mention BBatk buffs.
Also, Spark, Element and Crit are multipliers of the final figure. Again, the base Atk stat will just better further and further ahead.
My conclusion (and you probably already know) is that breaker is by far the best for damage. Anima is best for survival. If def blocked more than one third of def stat then it might be useful, however, mitigation prevents def being crucial. Rec, apart from this scenario, is not very useful.",1100.0

Washers are usually a little easier as they tend to be more readily available; they can be found at your local hardware store. These washers are typically described with words like: isolation, dampening, or cushioning and are usually made of a softer material like rubber/neoprene, felt, silicone, or some other soft/squishy material. I can't remember the sizing off-hand, but if you look around online you can use their measurements to find your own.

When reattaching, make sure not to over-tighten the screws.

The Wild are really good at keeping opponents along the boards and forcing outside shots.

* Why did you pass on Gevaermenn '90 in NM135?

* What's your reasoning to take Milan 2 over Chumat?

* No Fusiliers '90 for forest fighting?

* Does two BKAN 1A without a fob actually work? Sounds expensive

* Why did you take the Leo 2 over the K1? 2 extra armor and an additional M2 seem worth 5pts imo.

* Taking the F-15J seems strange to me. Planes like F-16A Block 15, Mirage 2000C RDI, Tornado F2 or JA 37 Viggen seem like a stronger option because you get 2 on elite. Basically, you get planes that hit more at a cheaper price.

If you go with the Haswell you put in your post, the upgrade path ends with DDR3 ram (which will become harder to find) and the i7 4790K processor - which is a great chip, but still a 2 year old processor that will be even older when you look to upgrade.

I did end up getting sick from being vegan--probably didn't do it properly--and am feeling much better now that I'm Paleo...But one thing I've learned is that anyone who has the will power to eat a certain way makes other people feel insecure, and this is where the criticisms come from.  Like in the article:: ""Your almonds and apples are making me feel insecure about my chips.""  This statement summarizes the reason behind all the criticisms we get.",1259.5928

"I love that class, but it's weaksauce as hell. I have no idea what your friend was doing, but it sounds like a serious misreading of the rules. The exact same class on the new wiki -- http://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Gravity_Warrior_%283.5e_Class%29

Pseudo-Strength is +2 Strength per 4 levels *for the purpose of strength checks* (skills, opposed combat rolls, etc. Not attacks or damage). It's beat out by a 2nd-level wizard spell level up until the Gravity Warrior is level 10, and even then it's up for debate which one I'd rather have.

The real strength of the class is anti-flight, the ability to make difficult terrain, and an AoE save-or-stun on a cooldown. It plays very well in games with Warblades &amp; Bards, but has a serious case of friendly fire.",1100.0

"&gt;Now let’s make some extra dextrines. The easiest way would be to take a cue from AmandaK and add some maltodextrin to the boil. Not a bad plan at all, especially if you were able to find maltodextrin that had a broad range of dextrine lengths. That sounds like more work for the research and acquisition.

&gt;Another option would be to add some Carapils to the sparge. Carapils is known for it’s dextrine content, and Briess says it can be steeped, so when you add the wheat flour, add the carapils to the sparge. Or cap the mash with it to get a small amount of conversion. Or both. How much Carapils? I don’t know yet. That’s for part 3

The game notifies players that are TKing or doing team damage and usually there's ample opportunity to change behavior and reduce the possibility of further instances and we would prefer that a player change their behavior rather than rely on the kindness of their teammates.

My point is, there may be more to it than just the sex piece. And the same goes for you, there are a lot of people out there.

1, For the past 2 decades China has focused more on internal stability and Economy building over military growth, this greatly restricts it's ability to enforce it's will overseas.

2, More importantly China is only really just starting to build an effective blue water navy and flex it muscles in the South China sea, which has already put the US on edge.

In the case of attempted Annexation of Taiwan, China has significantly reduced capacity to actually invade in the first place, even more so if the US commits large portions of it's navy to defending Taiwan and securing the waters around it.

I never liked when he was listed as a starter, and I could only see his worth as a late sub to help tired legs. Gonzales is a loss, but we have other outside backs to step in like Jones, Remick, Mears and Fisher. I'm hoping Ozzie is healthier this year too.

For our CBs, I'm happy with Marshall, Torres and Evans being used in rotation unless 2 get injured. In that case we hvae some younger players to look at like Ockford (looked shaky last year) and Lowe. We also have some really young players like Alfaro and Nelson that could surprise.

Why are authorized retailers who do business as Sprint often allowed to completely trash the corporate image with bad service and never forced to toe the line when it comes to quality customer support?

Why do the Sprint reps in the BAW forums repeatedly quote from the same copy/paste script and never directly answer customer questions?

For that matter, why are there so many customers in the BAW forums who do exactly what those employees tell them, PM the employee and never hear back?

I don't think being a loner is unhealthy, I actually think it shows strength in a world where people constantly need to be sharing their lives and seeking approval from their peers. I think the unhealthy part is when you start really disliking people altogether and give up trying to socialize. So all in all, I think you're doing well. Just take care of your body while your going to school, do something you actually enjoy doing for part of your day, and happiness will follow.

"Vet inte om de infördes av den anledningen, men det stämmer att man måste vara svensk medborgare för att kunna skaffa nationellt ID.

Jag känner en expat från Storbritannien som jobbar i Sverige. (Alltså en EU-migrant, innan det ordet började betyda tiggare på nyspråk.) Det kostar en jävla massa pengar för honom att förnya sitt brittiska pass, eftersom myndigheterna kräver att det ska sändas med kurir till Sverige för typ £100. Därför vill han ogärna använda det som ID till vardags, men han kunde samtidigt inte skaffa det nationella ID-kortet i Sverige eftersom han inte är medborgare. Om man nu i praktiken inte kan resa inom Norden med Skattemyndighetens ID så hamnar en massa människor i kläm. Fy fan vad dåligt genomtänkt allt detta är.

"If the Germans French and English invaded from Canada as well as the sea and hit the upper north east quickly, the US would most likely sue for peace after losing cities like Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit as well as New England and New York, major steel supplies, manufacturers and just all around money would be lost.  If the alliance pushed and took Chicago, I think its game over because Chicago is a central hub for most of the country, all rail I believe even that time went through Chicago. So if the US lost that, I don't think they'd be able to adequately supply the army they had left.   However if the US managed to bog down the alliance in New England and Detroit, I think the US would be able to crank out enough supplies to drag on the war, however even if the US was able to retain its territory at the time, the tull would be insurmountable and would most likely have pushed the US into the Great Depression a decade early.

I'll second what she said about about asking ""x Veterinarians"" and getting ""x"" number of opinions, and likewise agree with her suggestions for management: conservative is ok if things keep going well. If they don't, surgery will be essential.

I think the most critical pieces of information your vet(s) need to help you make a decision is a second set of radiographs or a contrast study to make sure the obstruction is still moving. If the obstruction isn't complete or the mass is moving, there's a good chance you'll be able to make it to your vet at home.

"Okay well the reason monkfish/fishing trawler is useful is some decks focus on doing as much damage as fast as possible to you so you need lots of healing to survive while you build your attack throughout the match thats its gameplay advantage. 

Next, you can only have 2 of a card in your deck but some cards have the effect ""gain"" x card x1/x2/x3 fishing trawler for example gives you 3 monkfish cards that cost 0 and heal 8 each but fishing trawler costs 4 gold.

Gain sometimes will give you cards you can normally add to your deck like wormbrain giving you elvarg which means you can gain 1 elvarg from the 2 wormbrain in your deck and also have 2 elvargs in your deck for a total of 4. Gain will also sometimes give unique cards like monkfish that you can't just put in your deck and draw it whenever. If a card says gain on it you don't need to own the card in your card list or have it in your deck. ",1100.0

Hjarnen vs Shiphtur- Hjarnen has a tough matchup vs. H2K, but should be easy vs. Giants. Shiphtur has 2 tougher games, but Dig tends to fight and perform despite losses. Your predictions have them relatively close as well. I just don't know which to play here.

I was leaning towards H2K for this week as I expect them to win both games, and NRG didn't look that good against IMT last week, so I was thinking they'd have a pretty tough match against TSM. Your predictions however show NRG having a STRONG 2-0 while H2K looks more like a barely 2-0 maybe a 1-1. Do you think NRG is really more of a lock to go 2-0?",1293.311572

But the big reason for the cancellation was that WSJ didn't want another long runner series, Mx0 was in a time while Naruto and Bleach were big, Hunter x Hunter was still releasing, Reborn was growing after stop being a gag manga, including others like Neuro, To Love-ru, D. Gray Man and etc. So Mx0 for me will be way better than Naruto, Bleach, Reborn, Neuro, To love-ru and D.gray man, but the voting system from Jump show otherwise and they decide to cancel Mx0 so they didn't have another long running manga (I know this because since I read it weekly and the scanlator forum when mad becuase of Mx0 cancellation, so the translator told us that was the reason, that I think it is most accuracy since it didn't get to ch 100)",1100.0

"There's definitely a route into the security industry based on what you can do rather than your educational credentials. Note that there is a difference between ""what you can do"" and your technical skills.


The most difficult part of getting a serious job at your age is the perception that youth are unreliable and can't consistently deliver a project. Make sure that you document to the contrary in your CV, have stories about project delivery prepped for an interview, and prove yourself a counter-example once you're hired. Also, be prepared to talk about your accomplishments in both technical (how you did it) and business language (why you did it/what problems did you solve).


If you have solid technical skills and can consistently deliver projects in a business-relevant way, you'll go far even without a college degree.

"&gt; Each received a white robe from the Emperor's wardrobe, and from his sponsors a full set of Frankish garments, with arms, costly robes, and other adornments. This was done repeatedly and more and more [Norsemen] came each year, not for the sake of Christ but for mundane advantages. [...] As there were not enough linen garments to go around on [one] occasion, Louis ordered some old shirts to be cut up and tacked together to make tunics or be run up as overalls. When one of these without more ado was put on a certain elderly envoy, he regarded it suspiciously for some time. Then he lost control of himself completely and said to the Emperor: ""Look here! I've gone through this ablutions business about twenty times already, and I've always been rigged out before with a splendid white suit; but this old sack makes me feel more like a swineherd than a soldier!""

The timeline to become a practicing physician is grueling. Med school + interning + residency + optional fellowships would aptly prepare you to practice so I don't think being experienced as an RN/PA before would really give you an edge in education (at least, for the investment to be worth it).

That being said, LECOM has a program that bridges from PA to DO: http://lecom.edu/academics/the-college-of-medicine/accelerated-physician-assistant-pathway/

There are PAs, RNs and NPs who go off to med school because they genuinely want to change their careers, which is fine. But knowing that your end goal is med school, I feel like going through the application cycle and years of schooling to become something else would just be a waste of money and time for you.

"Are we really going to get passionately involved in a pointless argument about racist peaches?

[Alright.](http://i.imgur.com/YrR9lYI.gif)

Saying all peaches have big pits isn't racist because they *do* have big pits.  It's just an observation, and there's not explicitly negative connotation to the statement.  However, if you say all peaches have disgusting fuzz, **that** is racist.  Not all of them do, and those that do may have more or less than others, and the fuzz itself isn't always disgusting.

"What you probably heard about is probably the difference between 売主 and 仲介 homes for sale.

In some cases the real estate company will purchase lands, build houses on it, and sell it themselves(hence the agency is the 売主). These are the instances wherein you don't need to pay commission.

Whereas if some home owner is selling the house through the agent, the transaction becomes 仲介, so commission has to be paid.

Its not too uncommon to find complete new homes on sale by the 売主, but its far more common to find plots of land for sale by the 売主 that you can buy and build a house on.

Consumption tax only applies to the house and not the land so if you buy just the plot of land its consumption tax free (still gotta pay property tax tho).

One thing with buying land though if there is still an old house on it, you gotta pay to have it taken down which can get pretty expensive, like 20man per tsubo if i remember correctly. So if you look for land to buy make sure you get it 更地引渡し.

"I'm guessing this is similar to phentermine. I can see the value in needing to see a dramatic weight loss for motivation. Here is the important part that you need to remember: the super fast results you get at first won't continue. Your overall progress won't STOP, but it will slow down. I think it worked for about 2 weeks for me a few years ago, and then it stopped, and I stopped taking it, because I wasn't seeing any more benefit to it, and it wasn't worth the anxiety it gave me. What I SHOULD have done was to stick with counting calories, but I didn't fully ""get"" that weight loss would slow with or without the medication.

If you do take it, I'd suggest getting a blood pressure cuff from the drugstore (one of the little ones that go on your wrist) so that you can monitor your bp while taking it.

**What you wish you'd known when picking a law school**: I would have taken the LSAT again.  I did fairly well, but I would have studied more rigorously.

"It's exactly what you said. There's a market for it.

A smaller sensor doesn't necessarily mean worse, just different. If bigger was automatically better, we would all be out to buy a Phase One. 

The fact is, an APS-C sized sensor gives you a few advantages:

For one, the autofocus points cover more area on the sensor. This means that if the spot you want to autofocus on happens to be close to the edge of the sensor, you will have more luck focusing with an APS-C camera than a full frame or larger.

Another is reach. This is debated sometimes, but that debate is mostly semantics. If you stick a 300mm lens onto a 24megapixel full frame sensor and then the same 300mm lens onto a 24megapixel APS-C sensor, your photo will appear 1.6x ""closer"" to the subject on APS-C vs full frame.

I feel bad for Staples just like I felt bad for Circuit City when they folded, but it was probably the companies fault for not enacting a business strategy that would keep them afloat. 

Take a look at Fry's electronics. They are still doing great because they offer many things you simply can't find elsewhere.

Sure WM is evil, but we need to tackle other problems first to deal with that ball of wax. ",1250.14326

&gt; it's common that verbs still mark the nominative - that is they agree with the absolutive in intransitive and with the ergative in transitive clauses.

Except that ergative =/= nominative in transitive clauses. What you mean is that they mark the **subject** (in this case, a more agent/actor-like argument, but the whole notion of subject in ergative languages is very controversial). In ergative languages, the absolutive is the case that is analogous to the nominative, and in fact many linguists working on ergative languages (such as Stan Starosta) choose to use the term *nominative* instead of *absolutive*.",1100.0

"For me it all started to fall into place and become more clear as I started to notice the difference between wanting and knowing. I became aware of the fact that I would sometimes just *know* that a material desire would somehow appear in my life - and it always did. I noticed that the things I wanted, the things that seemed so far from my grasp, were the things I would never get.  
  
Around the same time all this realization was going on I was also working on my self awareness, self love and self forgiveness/respect. I realized I was in a deep comfort zone and not at all happy so I decided to be more aware of my thoughts and actions.

Your computer is infinite, so it can check all of them, so the question then becomes how many of these decompressed GB files match your validation attributes.

But in reality she is next to him and moving around. If she thinks nothing is around her she feels that she can walk in those areas right? Example. You are in a empty room. Lights are turned off and it's is pitch black. Your natural night vision has yet to fully kick in. You believe nothing is around you. You walk forward. Someone quietly places a log in  front of you. You trip and fall. You didn't know it was there... this could have easily happened to Yang. She could have tripped on Mercury and things would have gone differently. But story reasons. 

The whole point is to showcase that there was something fishy going on. We had already seen odd dealings in a Mercury match. The audience doesn't see this stuff. They see horrible things. Are scared and sad. This sets up other stuff.

"I'd say by releasing VR early for star citizen it will allow competitors to learn from their mistakes and triumphs. this is probably why they prefer to focus our perception of the game development on just the game; without a doubt they have a team somewhere working on VR implementation on and off for at least a year now.

better to trust what they're doing in house and be happy they're not using VR as an excuse for falling behind in anything.

wasn't impressed with them for a long while but the current alpha is shaping up nicely, they've made the game to play like how we all wanted it to play i.e seamless transition from fps to flying, quick space jumping, multicrew, communication. if they tidy up the bugs and make it smooth it will be a very special game ",1263.6389

Ireland has plenty of electricity production capacity since we built a bunch during the boom and energy consumption has been flat for nearly a decade now.

"I think you are worried that the kinetic energy of the particles will tend to infinity, since they are always being accelerated away from each other. That isn't the case, because the force falls off as 1/r^(2). So it is like in Zeno's paradox, the speed keeps increasing but just approaches a finite level. Another way of saying the same thing is that  the potential energy between them is proportional to 1/r, which is finite as r goes to infinity.

Now what you are worrying about would be a problem in a 2D universe, or equivalently if you took those charges and spread them out along two infinitely long parallel wires. In that case, the force between them falls off as 1/r, and the potential will be proportional to ln(r). The wires really would accelerate asymptotically to the speed of light. Fortunately, we don't live in a 2D universe and making an infinitely long wire is impossible.",1238.14552

For the record, I don't know if I would say that not much about him is in our scriptures.  Judaism teaches that the written Torah is an extreme shorthand that was given in tandem with a great expansive orally transmitted explanation, and that this explanation is recorded in the Talmud, and in other texts.  I would hesitantly liken these lehavdil to the hadith, with the caveat that while the hadith are understood to postdate Mohammed entirely and there is, as far as I understand, debate within Islam as to their validity, in contrast the Talmud is understood to be content received by Moshe and the Jewish people at Sinai, passed on and eventually written down out of necessity and is seen within traditional Judaism as authoritative and inerrant.",1100.0

Sometimes, and frankly I don't remember all of those votes, one is put in a position of having to make very very difficult choices about whether you vote to provide food for hungry kids or health care for people who have none and other programs. But, in general, I do support increasing funding for NASA.

It sounds like political hedging - the amount of need for kids and health care and ""other programs"" is huge , there won't be anything left for NASA.

"&gt;Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present, causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer.

each period t, the cap charges up by ~.707 times the difference between its current voltage and the supply voltage. Note: t is in seconds.

T=5t

In about 5 periods of t, called T, a capacitor is considered fully charged. (Fully meaning that the capacitor will have approximately the same voltage as the supply - it is not relative to the maximum voltage of the capacitor which, again, is just a maximum).

If you had a circuit with resistance 1000 ohms (1kOhm) and a capacitor with 500kuF, it would take about 2500 seconds to fully charge the capacitor.

The thing that struck me is how quiet it was.  You could almost make out the conversations in the stands on the other side of the drag strip, despite the 8-12s quarter mile times (the former being an overpowered home built electric motorcycle).",1100.0

Not really. The xkcd talks about it, too. You'd need to be 2.3AU away from a supernova to get enough neutrinos to kill you. There's no practical solution to build a weapon with so much energy to kill someone with neutrinos. You could use a fraction of that energy to destroy (pretty much) everything, without neutrinos.

Neutrinos are so impractical to kill, that it'd be easier to use a beam of photons (laser, pew pew). For me it seems, neutrino weapons are (one of) the most impractical weapons you can think of.",1100.0

With rape there are no safe words. There is no consent. There is no respect. Dom/sub and other types of sex play and fantasies are completely different. They have nothing to do with rape and are separate consensual actions. So I get OP's questions and I get the other posters' issues.",1273.89536

Honestly? that this point I would just not invite your mum..

How can you have the happiest day of your life when you're worrying about all the drama? how can you cut the cake after your mum gets into a cat fight with dad's girlfriend and shoves her into it? how will you cope when your mum brings her abusive ex despite your wishes?

Maybe give her a warning. that if she won't quit it she's out. honestly though, it's redonk that you would even have to do that. she's a grown woman. Hire security for the weeding in case of the abusive ex, your mum coming when not wanted, or any fights, and send a message around to your family telling them the situation and asking for their support in whatever it is you actually decide to do.

In his family, if someone was sick/hurt and anyone showed actual compassion, then the sick person ""won"" and the person who offered to care for (or even so much as *acknowledged*) the sick person ""lost"".  It was always about claiming victimhood, playing ""poor pitiful me"", and control to him.

The thing is, he would complain of extreme illness and/or pain, but he wouldn't do **anything** to try to feel better! It was also very telling that when he realized that he couldn't ""compete"" with my chronic, degenerative spinal condition, he actually accused me of milking my condition and **wanting** to be disabled!

"No worries I'm happy to help any way I can! I went through three loses. After our second loss we checked my hormone levels as soon as I found out I was pregnant.

With the hormones I made it to 17 weeks before my water broke. 

Turns out in addition to the bicornate uterus which can cause early miscarriages, I have an incompetent cervix which opened way too early. Probably because the bicornate uterus was putting extra pressure on my cervix when it was full of baby.

So, when you guys are ready, I highly reccomend talking to your obgyn about surgery, checking hormone levels, what the doctor thinks needs to happen to help you two get to the finish line.

"I think your really missing the main reason we use bolt action for sniper rifles vs Simi auto for designated marksman rifles (there is a difference ) a free floating barrel is significantly more accurate and has better harmonic characteristics it will also be more consistent as I understand it. A Simi action has the gas tube attached and this effects harmonics

A bolt action rifle also carries more energy because none of the potential energy is used for cycling the bolt.  Also the bolt cycling will potentially mess up your shot placement due to the forces that act on the rifle during recoil not being all in a straight line and the additional weight moving around. 

I mean snipers build DOPE based off the bullets lot number from the manufacturer because pulling from a single lot number ensures the most consistency in balistics from round to round. So tiny variations or inconsistencies are unwelcomed typically.

In 2008, author Ron Alsop called the Millennials ""Trophy Kids,"" a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been reported that it's an issue in corporate environments. Some employers are concerned that Millennials have too great expectations from the workplace.  Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations. Newer research shows that Millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment. Millennials look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong work–life balance in their jobs.

That doesn't seem to be the case.

We only have a single force-user protagonist so far (among the new characters). Are we really going to have every single force user protagonist in the saga from now on always be a Skywalker? it makes the whole ""Force"" thing feel like a genetic trait rather than a mystical energy field that binds the galaxy together and allows people to tap into hidden superpowers.

Best Coffee:

* Sweet Science in Adam's Morgan (No wifi though)

* Filter (multiple locations)

* Wydown

* The Coffee Bar (shaw, downtown)

* Chinatown Coffee Company

Best Espresso:

* Slipstream on 14th

* La colombe

* Peregrine (multiple)

Best places to work from:

 * Slipstream (but only during the day, they turn into a bar at night)

 * Soho Cafe on P (huge but the coffee is lousy)

 * Tryst in Adam's Morgan (big and ok coffee, but often crowded)

 * Qualia in Petworth

 * Compass in Shaw

 * Bourbon coffee downtown (decent sized but often full of students. Nice atmosphere and the coffee is ok)

If you're in Nova Grape &amp; Bean is great.

"I live in Newcastle UK. 


In my home town their are two major football clubs (Soccer) There is Newcastle United, and across the river is Sunderland Football Club. Now these two teams hate each other, and i mean HATE. Every time they play together there is police everywhere because shit gets real if they meet in the street after a match, mostly because there is a lot of rioting and fighting that happens.


So i would assume that if the world had ended the be two big factions would be the two teams that have kept their hate and rivalry through the years.

Newcaslte Untd are locally known as ""The Toon"" or ""Toon army"" and Sunderland Fc is known as ""The Macums"". I think they'd keep there names and hate. The Toon Army would wear black and white striped armour and clothing and The Macums would wear red and white striped armour and clothing. And with being separated by the River Tyne and the River Wear, there hate would become stronger.

The short version is that the city will reimburse certain costs of building infrastructure like roads and parks on the site (est $60 million) as well as continuing operating costs such as security, medical response, and shuttles for events (est $8 million annually) after the stadium is operating to the point of generating $25 million a year in taxes. The justification for this is that these are services that would normally be provided by the city anyway. If this is a good deal for taxpayers or not is yet to be seen.

Men lige præcis denne historie bygger på mildest talt problematisk journalistisk arbejde. Det er en andenhåndskilde og Espersen er aldrig blevet kontaktet i forbindelse med artiklen. Derudover er overskriften misvisende, da Espersen aldrig direkte snakker om dansk blod.

I mean, I could believe a 13.6 with a badass driver, but a 13.1? No fuckin way. Not without gearing so short that the car would be unusable on the highway. 

They only have 270ish whp and 350z's aren't light enough for that kind of power to net those times. A 13.4 doesn't seem *entirely* out of the realm of possibility but conditions would have to be absolutely perfect with a factory freak car and one hell of a driver.

I'd expect a bone stock F-Body to be able to run mid 12s more often than a 350z can run a 13.1. Spoiler alert, F-Bodies don't run mid 12s in stock form. Ever. With any driver. At any track...

"I actually got in touch with the MTO last summer to ask about buying a Highway 69 sign. Here was their response:

Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of Ontario, represented by the Minister of Transportation (the ""Ministry""), created and has been using the highway shield and owns all intellectual property rights in the highway shield.  The highway shield is a significant and integral part of the Ministry's business and is used for directional/safety purposes.
Selling or using the shield for any reason other than Ministry business would be an infringement on the property rights of Her Majesty the Queen.
The ministry therefore disposes of old highway signs instead of selling or donating them.  Our contractor takes the aluminum extruded signs for scrap and the wood signs for disposal, unless the sign being removed is common (e.g. overhead Hospital signs, overhead Truck Restriction etc.) and is in good shape.  If this is the case, we will ask the contractor to deliver them to us for future re-use.",1100.0

The point is that *I* need to feel okay about myself in order to feel turned on, even if my partner thinks I'm the sexiest woman in the world.

Basically, build a table with 3 columns.  The first column will be all combinations of ""Model X Variable Y"" that can be selected.

This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.

"I honestly prefer to have a main base, loud and proud style, with almost minimal loot inside. Then I would have 3 or 4 tiny alt bases with all of my main loot. I would play mostly around my main base, gathering resources, killing players, and gaining infamy, remembering to store major loot and resources in alt bases. When a geared player stumbles across my base and in a fit of pique decides to C4 it to the ground, I simply leave and spawn into one of my alt base, grab materials, and set up another base in a new area which will become my main base. After maybe a month or two, I change the locations of my alt bases, but keep the structure intact, so anybody smart enough to find my alt bases may raid it in the future and find nothing but empty chests, traps, and a sign saying ""ERROR 404: Loot does not exist""

My signature dick move, you could call it.

"Personally I don't like the overall footprint of the holster. I'm small so I feel all that neoprene is too much and can be done away with. I also don't like the belt hooks it uses. I feel that they move to easily even when tightened and the large neoprene footprint doesn't help either with keeping it secure and in place at around 4 if I ever wear it. Also, it could be because it was new, but when I'd try and holster my m&amp;p 9 fs, it would catch the slide and start to rack it. That's just not safe. 

Edit: I ended up buying a safari land iwb that you can adjust the can't and I love it minus the hook it uses, it slides under the belt and when you draw catches when you pull. So the holster has a tendency to sink lowered than I'd like if I don't sinch my belt enough.",1270.144868

A CPU core is made of transistors (think tiny switches) that together can perform small operations like add,sub,divide,etc. Depending on the amount and pattern the CPU can accomplish the instructions more efficiently taking less clock (3 GHz means 3 billion clocks per second). Newer generations seek to improve upon this by fitting more transistors by shrinking the size and optimizing the patterns.

A core is a 'duplicate' of that arrangement that is (for the most part) independent of the other. Thus while one core is adding two numbers, the other core could be subtracting two other numbers. This allows side by side task and operations to have huge performance boost.",1100.0

"I wonder how (pre-)historically accurate this game is. I can already see they messed up on the linguistic front. For example, they saw the tiger and called out ""tigré"". But there's absolutely no way that word would've been in use 12000 years ago.

Edit: The first use of that word in its form (tigre) would be around the 9thish century, in descendants of Latin. This comes from Tigris in Latin, which is already a different sounding word. Continue to go back in time, and it will only become more and more different, until eventually it's entirely different. And this is assuming they're speaking a language related to Proto-Indo-European.

Do we know where the game is set?

I may be acting picky, but it's hard to see their invented language as believable if it sounds like a western language spoken in the 1300s. Either get an actual linguist to do the language, or just use English. Though that's my opinion.

I'm not going to say that all sexual acts outside of your two conditions are inherently wrong (certainly not, because that would include procreative heterosexual sex, which we know for certain is permitted and encouraged between a married couple).

"Vayne's condemn adds a stack of silver bolts to the enemy. This is very situational but can be helpful in trading or landing the quick three silver bolts proc for the kill in a situation where every second matters ( low health under the turret or both players at one auto attack's health.)



 Moreover, when dueling or being chased by a champion with certain gap closers (jax, irelia, etc ), use condemn on them while you're both out of your respective range. This will ensure that as soon as you get into condemn range, you'll condemn. 9 times out of 10 these champions will begin with their gap close, and because of condemn's cast time, the enemy will be pushed away while in the air. Afterwards, proceed to kite safely. ",1100.0

"Well, I'm not saying you *have to have* so many steps in your routine - I like mine to be quite elaborate, simply because I enjoy it that way, I enjoy the feeling that I'm doing myself good. For others, skincare is really just about the rough basics, because they don't need more than the cleanser-moisturiser-sunscreen combo, and that's completely fine - after all, it's called *personal care* for a reason.

.

The reason I don't like mineral oil is that it makes me feeling quite greasy, and, what's more, I feel like when I apply a plant-derived oil of good quality instead, I get much more benefits than from mineral oil. I'm not questioning its moisturising and occlusive properties, but I find for example rosehip oil being *much* more moisturising, much more comfortable to wear, and, a big plus in my book, a dream at lightening PIH.

"&gt; If no one votes, there would be no one to enforce the monopoly on force that the state holds. 

So let me get this straight - your scenario is:

1. No one shows up to vote.
2. As a result, the police and such - ""the people who enforce the monopoly on force"" - all quit their jobs.
3. Profit!

Is this an accurate representation of your plan?

It's your step 2 that has me dubious.  Why exactly would the police quit their jobs and give up their paychecks?  Ever met any police officers?  Are you under the impression that they use force reluctantly and under pressure from the leaders?

Even step 1 seems pretty stupid.  While we're organizing all the good people to not vote, the bad people continue to vote, and we get bad government followed by worse government.

Honestly, I try to respect people's arguments, particularly idealistic ones, but this is far too naïve even for me!

If you look in the top of the fridge portion of the unit by the light you'll see a wire with a plug attached to light and running a thermistor attached to the cold fins.  Disconnect that plug, turn the whole thing off for about 10 minutes and turn it back on.  It should start to get cold again and the green light will flash.

This sets the PCB that controls the fridge into a default mode and clears the error you get from it getting to cold out.  After it get good and cold again reconnect the plug and you'll be good to go.

"What do you mean? It seems like you think that if a SO is drugged their inner ""cheatingness"" comes out or that this person is in anyway accountable for sexual assault or rape. Is that really what you mean? Because if that happens there is no blame on the SO. It wasn't their choice to be drugged or to be a part of any sexual activities. That would be an awful and tragic event and probably also a challenge for the couple, but that's another discussion. There's nothing to forgive or not. 

But if you're talking about a SO drinking or taking other drugs intentionally and then actively cheating, then yes - I believe that's something to decide about whether or not one should forgive.

Sorry about EDShipyard and not coriolis, I really prefer EDshipyard. This is my loadout, note that I didn't play with it since Horizons, so I haven't used the SCBs with the insane heat-gen. I'd swap out an A-booster with a heat sink pretty much.

Pythons are slower speed-wise and has worse manuevrability. However, the 3 Large hardpoints really show what it has going with the never ending capacitor. 714 MJ of shields, compared to an FDL with 6 boosters = 1029 MJ. It's really not that much worse! And the oversized PP makes it really fun with all the variations you can try.

Nazis aped socialist projects in order to get what leftists would call lumpenproletariat from Germany's depression - many of whom were ex-military - on side. Once the Nazis were actually in power they liquidated the faction that could be considered in perhaps the most perverse way 'socialists' in the Night of the Long Knives.

[Rzetelność Radia Maryja.](http://www.radiomaryja.pl/informacje/koalicja-po-psl-promowala-gender-za-pieniadze-resortu-srodowiska/) Chyba że chodzi o inny filmik.

A swoją drogą trzeba mieć coś ze łbem aby w tym spocie dopatrzeć się ideologii gender. Tyle że niektórzy przed oczami wszędzie widzą gejów bo zamiast pójść do klubu, znaleźć partnera i że tak powiem ulżyć sobie, wolą wpierdzielać się w życie innych.

Edit: W wypowiedzi RM chodziło zapewne o drugi filmik. Rzetelność gazety...oba filmiki dostępne są też tutaj:

"PVC pipe is a good start. However, it's a far cry from having something heavy and loose, as I'm sure you're aware of.

Do you have sandbags? Tie them together; make your own worm. Don't have sandbags? Go to your local grocery store, get onion or potato sacks if they use them, fill 'em with towels and clothes to start with, move up to dirt when you have the feel of it. 

Or duffel bags, same thing. Protip, use multiple trash bags inside, reduces the chances of leaking and tearing and whatnot. 

That's the hardest part of the worm, learning to work as a team, and making sure everyone is on the same page and ability level. Just practice, and you'll get it. 

Other ideas...if you or anyone you know is military, or knows someone on a base, see if you can get ahold of a telephone pole. Or just go out in any nearby woods and get a big fucking log. ",1100.0
"I'm very big on physics and electronics. There's great names to be had in those fields.

Subatomic particle names like *Electron, Proton, Neutrino, Boson* or *Tau* are all solid gold. You could try the awkwardly larger *Atom* or *Ion* if you're desperate.

Then there are awesome electrical terms like *Watt, Ohm, Ampere, Current, Diode, Zap* or *Transistor* that would sell big. Maybe one commemorating the greatest electrical inventor of all time would be in order, the *Edison* disc.

And let's not forget some associated science terms. *Sine/Cosine, Frequency, Throb* and *Stroke* come quickly to mind. *Movement* and *Rectifier* also seem appropriate for some strange reason.

"Correct. Some people say to put on a tiny bit of thin lube, others say not to. Some people say they've never had a problem not lubing them, others that they've destroyed bearings not lubing them. But that's pretty much it.

There's a danger of getting too much lube in the bearing and it can cause performance problems. If that happens you can clean it again in solvent. If it *keeps* happening you can understand someone deciding to run them dry.

Also--as far as I can tell by searching around online, no one really knows what's in all the different lube brands, so it seems possible that they actually behave differently and that's part of why everyone's had different experiences with it. And, you know, maybe some people are more lucky about the bearings wearing out or not.

Personally, I use the yoyotricks.com lube and haven't had any problem with it, and it's helped with bearing noise.",1100.0

She cornered me again after school, without her friend this time. I didn't really get what she was up to, still getting in my way, but just smiling and not saying a thing. I grabbed her by the arms again, this time leading her behind a classroom, and gave her a longer kiss. And then some light petting. She stopped before we got too far, put her finger to her lips for silence and scampered off again. 

We never did anything else, but she did smile at me from time to time. And to this day, I enjoy making out, and more, in semi secluded areas. ",1242.2004

There are 2 maps. One is more like a connection of big hallways, sort of like Assassin's Creed, which connect the larger mission areas. So it's more open than the Assassin's Creed main map, but by far not as much as GTA.

The second map is more open, mainly because it has much less mountainous terrain - so the second map is more like a GTA map, but still not 100%. There are still some areas you can't get to, although you would in a GTA game (unscalable cliffs, visible and invisible walls, hallway-like subareas at the edges, etc).

I don't really know any other game that is like MGSV, so it's hard to really compare. I think the best way to understand it is to just look at a map.

"Mint is more ""Windows-Like"" and is fairly easy to use, but Ubuntu has more support online for problems and whatnot.

Both are great though, but I prefer Mint and I have gamed on it.

Dang, really? That's brutal! But look at this way, a lot of the most fabulous people get judged for being different. The Björks, Patti Smiths, Lady Gagas, KD Langs. All those looks just mean you're thinking outside of the (apparently really small) style/gender box all those people are stuck in!

I always interpreted NLF Saitama to be a well... in /r/whowouldwin terms a strong brick. Yeah he can ""One Punch"" people- but there are some characters [he can't beat through physical force](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/3uq1rd/saitama/cxhkn2k) no matter how much he tries.

"In western Canada, the policing in small communities is done by the RCMP. It has issues but its easier to catch them because there is national training and national oversight of the RCMP. Not just officially, but the media and social justice activists. Also, it means that the policing done is small places isn't up to locals, who are bound to be personally involved and have conflicts of interest with the victims and/or criminals.
Come to think of it, another huge difference is that in Canada its not taboo to criticize conservative politicians the system itself. On Facebook, I am continually surprised by how many people in WI state think their Governor is sacred.

"Nope.

&gt; Using apps on your mobile device or computer, you essentially hand off, or cast, content to the Chromecast. Using the information it receives about what you want to watch, the Chromecast finds the material on the Internet and streams it directly from the source. This way, your phone or tablet’s resources aren’t hogged up with streaming tasks, and battery life doesn’t take a huge hit. Think of your mobile device or computer as a remote control for the Chromecast.

Basically, whatever device you're using to cast a video becomes the remote control, while your Chromecast directly plays the video.

You can use your device as you'd normally use it, you can even turn it off and the content playing on the TV will be unaffected. 

It uses your HDMI port, no compatibility issues AFAIK.",1100.0

Of all the things you can look at as indicators of a nation's progress towards stability and civility, more than a few brilliant minds would agree that you can look to a nation's treatment of women as an indicator.

"Yep, I'm like your friends; zero dating, not married, nothing and couldn't be happier. Most marriages, practically all of them become completely sexless just like in the movie American Beauty. And having been in so many relationships and married before, I know only too well that the phony 'nice' act women put on when you first meet comes off immediately as soon as you're married and/or you get them pregnant and/or get you over a barrel and in an impossible bind where you can't leave i.e., staying for the children, too much to lose, etc. And then become completely abusive psychopaths. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEPoO08IMog

But I was lucky that I had all the sex and children early on in my life when U.S. women were still half decent human beings (I'm older) so I know what it's all about, but I can't imagine what it would be like to be 18 and male today - that would be hell on earth.

I’m 3kg over my class but rather than cut now and risk lifting less on the day I figure just go for my best total and consider it a lesson learnt for next time. It’s a marathon not a sprint – that’s what I keep telling myself anyway.

I should be there or thereabouts looking at last year’s results but I also notice some of the same guys are coming back again (turns out you can compete twice in novice comps – who knew). So my plan is relax, enjoy and see what happens.

"&gt;With the base of ""thou shalt not kill"" however they are defending the ability to kill if attacked/etc. I don't get it... 

""Thou shalt not kill"" is more commonly understood as ""Thou shalt not *murder,""* and is rendered as such in many translations. In other words, a condemnation of unsanctioned/unjustified homicide rather than a blanket ban on all shedding of blood. The Bible is rife with examples of YHWH mandating capital punishment for certain crimes, acts of sanctioned vs unsanctioned homicide, killing someone who is committing a home invasion, self-defense, killing in war, etc. There's a long tradition in Christian theology of seeking to determine what forms of killing conform with their god's orders; I recommend looking into ""Just War theory"" for an overview.

TLDR for those who don't want to read it:

1) There's a large overlap in NA and EU LCS viewers, so running them on the same day hurts their ability to watch both.

2) NA LCS starts earlier in the day (noon) so EU can watch a good amount of it, and EU starts later in the day so NA can watch.

3) We aren't sure what's better, Bo2s or Bo3s. Everyone has an opinion (this is Reddit after all), but there are good reasons why Bo2 may be better - more games doesn't necessarily mean better. We'll keep ourselves open to switching based on how we see things play out this summer and beyond.

4) Just like we're keeping ourselves open to format changes, we're open to changing up what days we run on. Nothing's locked in stone.",1100.0

"So to be clear, your argument is: Human CO2 emissions are so small, that it is just as likely (or even more probable?) that the overall rise in CO2 is caused by natural emissions. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

[Here's a graph going back the better part of a million years.](http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/5_2_13_news_andrew_co2800000yrs_1050_591_s_c1_c_c.jpg)

As you can see, CO2 levels begin to rise sharply when humans start burning shit. This is corroborated with measurements of oxygen levels, which have been decreasing in accordance with the burning of carbon to produce CO2. 

We can do some abstract math to figure this out. Recently, overall CO2 has been rising by about 2 ppm every year (about **15 billion tons** annually).  Annual human emissions are about **30 billion tons** every year. So - not only is nature absorbing the amount it outputs, but it takes in about half of what we put out, as well.",1100.0

Likewise, my friend became a Wackenhut fire service contractor in Iraq, providing fire department services to both the military and nearby Iraqi communities.

"IF you are going to give the ""entirety"" of the RAID 5, and you don't plan to vMotion this anywhere else, you might want to NOT put a VMFS on there and instead turn off the SAS RDM Flag in the config options which would allow you to map the entire RAID5 straight through to the NAS VM.    
This would prevent anything else from using it, but would also eliminate the wonderful alarm that goes off in ESXi if you don't have enough free space on a given VMFS.  And of course it very slightly increases performance because you have eliminated a layer in between.

I would also think about whether the blanket you found it in had left your house recently. Did you take it to visit friends who might possibly wear that bra size? What else was in the dryer with that blanket? 

Did you yourself buy anything from that store recently? If so, is it possible that tag was in the changing room and attached to something you bought, and was then deposited in the dryer?

"I'm of the opinion that Daka isn't worth focusing on starring up. 

She has a few particular qualities that make her valuable:

* Her stun (Multi Target, and she has the potency to back it up)
* She's fast
* She can revive
* She can heal (without killing herself, unlike Talia)

The first three are entirely unaffected by her stats. The heal is based on her health, so that is improved with stars. And obviously her health increases, making her harder to kill. 

At level 70, the difference between her at 4 star and 7 star is 3000 health, which translates to 900 healing. 

Her primary stat is Int, but she has no special damage, so it doesn't particularly benefit her. It increases her basic attack damage since it's her primary, but her damage sucks anyways, and is completely not why you use her.

Obviously, she's better with more stars. Everyone is. But considering Cantina Shipments are already so slow, I think there are better uses of your tokens. ",1253.95086

PG: Michael Carter-Williams

PG: Darren Collison

SG: Jimmy Butler

SG: Giannis Antetokounmpo 

SF: Nikola Mirotic

SF: Chandler Parsons

PF: Pau Gasol

PF: Draymond Green 

C: Robin Lopez


Not too confident on some of the plays though. Giannis can be hit or miss, don't fully trust Mirotic as he has been a fluke recently, Parsons can be value but in his last 12 games he has been either &gt;6.2X 5 times and &amp;lt;3.5X 7 times so there is no between and I don't know if Green will lose minutes because it will be a blowout and because their playing the Lakers, so I honestly don't know. 

I will also be looking at Cassipi if he plays, Barea if Deron is out and Bogut for Lopez because its hard to trust any Knicks player even with Lopez killing the Hawks the other day.

I'm editing to add - ladies, if you have thick chocolately jelly like returns, pain during intercourse, pain during bowel movements, ""period poops"" ( you will know what I'm talking about), extreme bloating, pain during urination, repeat non bacterial urination/bladder problems (cystitis etc) PLEASE get yourself to an OBGYN and tellt hem you suspect endo. If they don't listen to you - go to another or sit there until they do a lap.

A laparoscopy remains the only way to visually diagnose endo, so if they offer ultrasound etc, explain that you know this won't diagnose endo (but they may want to rule out other things).

"Solutions Architect/Software Architect

We're running an IBM MQ Asynchronous architecture with a legacy tandem as system of record for the legacy in-house app, but have recently integrated with third party web-services (SOAP, not REST). We're having an issue with the API calls reaching the external message broker just fine but not getting any returns even though the third party logs show responses were sent just fine.  

Whats the first thing you look at and why?

Answer: The timeout value on the IBM MQ messaging queue. If the timeout value is shorter than the time it takes to receive and ETL integrate the API response - into your legacy tandem data - then your front end app will simply show that data isn't available. Likewise..eventually your messaging queue will fill up with API responses that were never picked up and then your entire architecture is clogged up like a bad shitter pipe.  ",1100.0

&gt; The time-frame of the scene is twenty-four seconds (33 - 9). 24 - 5 (for the core charging) leaves 19 seconds. That's enough time for his attack to go slower than the meteor and still reach it in time

I'm fairly certain the blast hit really quickly, that's how its shown in both the manga and anime.

&gt; even then, it really doesn't matter how fast his energy blast were as they were amped twice over. What his energy attacks did in chapter 21 can't be attributed to what happened in chapter 17 due to the upgrades.

Of course Ignite can win the lane more often than Exhaust, but the assumption there is that the lane was lost, or at least you were not able to snowball it and the enemy laner got his farm (and that happens for lots of reasons other than having exhaust over ignite.. Sometimes the enemy comp is simply stronger early in the game, the enemy jungler applies more pressure than yours, an all-in move goes wrong, you simply misplay...)

Also, ignite is only particularly good if the lane already have some kill potential without it. It won't turn i.e a vayne + soraka lane into a highly dangerous one out of nowhere by itself, and sometimes is better to just accept that and get Exhaust for the late game instead.",1100.0

- Cons: Have to take the props off to get the Phantom in the bag, won't fit a large tablet

Anything that comes in [this hardshell case](http://amzn.com/B016084QN2)

- Pros: Fits Phantom with props on, has wheels and a pop out handle, still small enough to fit in the overhead bin of an airplane, fits larger tablets like the iPad Air.
- Cons: Heavy, big, harder to carry, so you have to roll it

I personally use the backpack. A friend of mine has a variation of the second one and loves it. That rolling case is used by several different suppliers (they just change the inserts), so look around for ones that look exactly like it and you might be able to get a better price than what I linked to. I actually have the same exact case for a 3-lamp video light kit.",1100.0

I'll give you a PS4 example from yesterday. My party of 5 joined an Automatch Cloak and Dagger game that was 1 vs 1 and the Defender suddenly had 6 Attackers to deal with instead of one. Sure, after he got killed and the game moved to the next map, we got split into 3 vs 4, but the issue is the 1 vs 6 part.

On PS4 it warries. I can instantly CQC a guy saved from a Fulton again right after he lands most fo the time, even if he was stunned before the Fultoning. I can farm interogation and stun points like this. However the wake up animation triggers sometimes, but it's quite rare. When it does, I can't CQC him and he's immune to stun damage, so I have to shoot him - which is how it should be.

"og hvem dælen siger at laveste kontanthjælps (for under 30 år) er der der sådan en basis indkomst skal sættes ? målet er netop og sætte indkomsten på et sådan niveau at man kan leve rimeligt for det, men at det alligevel skal være attraktivt at arbejde for at få råd til yderligere luksus, pointen er jo netop ikke at det blot skal dække det absolutte eksistensminimum (tag over hovedet, mad på bordet) men være en ydelse man kan leve af, ikke leve fedt af, men alligevel får skruet en rimelig hverdag sammen på.

hvis satsen er sat så lavt er størstedelen af fordelene smidt ud af vinduet, man skal op i nærheden, og måske endda forbi, højeste kontanthjælpsats før det egentligt batter i praksis.

Apparently he felt all better and thought not telling me and doing his typical night time routine was supposed to shout ""let's fuck"". And then he proceeded to get angry when the TV was shut off and I took the dog out because he wasn't going to bed and he doesn't feel sick anymore he wants to have sex.,

- doing a clean install of my NVIDIA drivers, making sure to NOT install the NVIDIA audio drivers.
- moving my dongle from port to port, and using the extension cable to move it around my desktop.
- Reinstalling chipset drivers
- Reinstalling USB drivers
- Reinstalling/updating BIOS
- Rolling many drivers back (all are currently up to date)
- Reinstalling software where this issue was most present.
- Running with and without CUE (neither seemed to reduce effect)
- Disabling all wireless devices connected to my computer, and moving things like cell phones away.
- Disabling all ""enhancements"" in playback devices
- Using default drivers (no CUE drivers) for headset

2) castle doctrine laws do NOT mean you can shoot/kill anyone trespassing in your home. all a ""castle law"" does is negate the otherwise applicable duty to retreat before defending yourself with force. so if someone's attacking you on the street in most cases if you can get away you have to do so before using force (unless there's a ""stand your ground"" law). if your state has a castle law (or case law equivalent), then you don't have to attempt to retreat from an attacker by leaving your home. make sense?

Well there's your problem. You gave up after one week.   
  
  
Look, I struggled with weight loss way before I joined the Army. The MOST correct answer is also the simplest one, and also the hardest one, because it requires you to stick with it. Eat less. No, seriously, that's it. That's all you have to do. I'm not saying it's easy, because simple does not necessary mean easy. It's the hardest thing I ever did. It's about willpower, soldier.   
  
If you're already getting chaptered, maybe it's too late. But your weight isn't going to change when you leave the military. Maybe you're okay with being a fattie once you get out.

"From a /r/mtgfinance perspective, gambling on these lots won't ever really be a good ideal, unless you happen across someone who simply doesn't know what they have. 

I've had success buying lots at auctions, garage sales, and estate sales, since the direct seller is rarely the previous owner of the cards.

I actually dump a lot of my spare cards on craigslist, though that's best for new players that just want bulk commons/uncommons to use on a budget rather than to make money on. Maybe I'm the exception but I regularly sell off 10-15k worth of random commons and uncommons for $20-30 just to get rid of them. I make it clear exactly what's in the lot including the set range if applicable, and the people I've sold the packs to seem happy to have them. I also offer basic lands at not extra cost as most of the people I've sold to are just buying a pile of cards to play around with.

For example:

2. the guy is freaking running out of palace. Even $10 dollar headphones will hear that.

7. he is just checking the far right of the smoke as the CT could be walking through there.

17. it's very logical that the guy is coming there OR from the connector that the other CT is covering

"Uzuurussha is northwest of Yamato, in what is known as Sakha/Yakutia today, deep in the heart of Siberia. Mongolia would be west of Izuruha in the Itsuwari no Kamen map, basically below Uzuurussha. It might have possibly even sunk beneath the sea like China and the Korean Peninsula.

[Here's the map of the Empire of Yamato](http://i.imgur.com/uuCixga.png) for reference. I took a screenshot of the relevant scene from this episode and drew the borders of Yamato.

1. Black - Borders of the Empire of Yamato
2. Red - Maruruha (occupied by Uzuurussha)
3. Green - Yamato proper
4. Blue - Kujuuri

"IMO the thing about Walmart is, a lot of people like to talk bad about it but in reality they come anyway because of their belief that our prices are the best. And then when they come, they might be disappointed by the lack of customer service and knowledge of the employees (i.e. They can't find someone and there's no one around to ask. When they want to ask a question about a product, they'll probably find that the employee has little knowledge of it other than its location (if even that).) Then they get frustrated and annoyed, not realizing that there's a trade off if you want lower prices. If you go to a store like target, you'll probably pay more but you might get better customer service. If you go to a specialty store, there's a good chance you'll get good customer service and knowledgeable employees, but you'll probably pay significantly more. Everyone wants the best of both worlds, but when it comes down to it, most people want the lower prices more than anything else.",1271.80394

"Somehow replaying to these highly detailed 'what card should i craft'-threads is way more difficult than the 1 sentence ones. You seem to have a strong grasp of the game already so shouldn't you know by now the kind of decks you enjoy and the cards that you need for them? Most of the cards on that list fit only to certain decks.

I guess the Ancient of Lore is the most multipurpose card on the list since it fits all the Druid lists apart from Fel Reaver aggro, you said you enjoy combo druid and you need Lore for that. Ice Block, Shield Slam and Lightbomb are all key cards in their respective decks. Of the legendaries I suppose Antonidas, Alexstraza, Jaraxxus and Grom are all good. Harrison Jones might be the pick if you want a legendary that fits to a lot of decks as a tech card. Malygos is an amazing legendary but since you don't play the classes that use him I'd skip Maly. All the Paladin stuff is great.

"I sincerely didn't intend for the paranoid grandpa comment as demeaning in any manner -- ""your"" there was meant to be third person, any person's grandpa.  My grandfather, like many who lived through or were born of the great depression, is frugal in ways that would be inefficient for even a small business, much less a government to function.  It's not a slight upon myself that he's that way, it's not even a slight upon him -- it's just not a good way to run a government.

It is, unfortunate, that I included that smarmy twist of your (completely inoffensive) words, as you've chosen to derail the conversation entirely and ignore pretty much everything but.

You may have 1 cable with 3 connectors like my psu which makes it easy.  It'll have one end that is an 8 pin (iirc) and then the other end will have an 8 pin, and then a 2 or 3 inch cable extension, then a 6+2 pin.  Use that cable if you have it.

This creation engine they have developed for years since before morrowind. This engine was created to allow players to crack the game open and mod it as they please and to make creation as easy as possible. Remember guys Bethesda is a team of about &gt;150 people so for them to make a game this big is incredible. Fallout 4 is not a duplicate game like most games or hate to say it cock of doody. They really do innovate each time around and give players the freedom to do what they want to do in a massive world it's not about graphics it's about the games you want to play. If its not your cup of tea still give it an honest try and if even afterwards you don't like it a new game should be out that you do like. If you do like it maybe you can find endless hours of enjoyment like I do in the game. Bethesda cares about what the gamers want if they didn't they would still be making games like madden and call of duty.,1100.0

"&gt; printing on stand up pouches 

What do you mean by this?  Please provide us with a link to the product so we can reference the specs.  It would also be helpful to know what kind of printer you currently have or would like to consider purchasing.

Normally when printing on 3d objects such as a cylander, sphere or cube its best to attempt printing onto a sticker first.  This is the easiest way for a consumer printer to provide you with a custom result.  The next option is typically shrink wrap.  Special shrink wrap media and printers can be purchased with the same idea as printing on a sticker.  The difference is that you print on a flat sleeve and then seal the shrink wrap around the object after printing.  The last option is normally printing to the media when it is flat and then forming it into the 3d object afterwards.  There isn't a good way to print on a round or non flat shaped media, you have to print on something flat first and then transfer it over.

The gist of the argument was that at that age you should be learning to love words, language, stories etc and the technical aspects of language take huge amounts of time which could better be used on other things.

[citation needed]

Kids can absorb huge amounts of information. English Language and English Literature were treated as separate subjects when I was at school, and English Language was dull as dishwater because there was nothing in it, I don't think I learned anything at all in it.

Actually teaching kids some grammar, so long as it is descriptive and not prescriptive grammar, is a useful thing. These are the people who will be developing the voice recognition systems that control the starship Enterprise (seriously, voice recognition is going to actually be usable soon (no, Siri is not useable)); this demands a detailed technical understanding of language.",1243.3216

"Awesome part about it is both systems would work pretty great actually if those same exact policies were put in place for the ACA. It is an artificial corrupt garbage market where the prices get broken up between 2 walls before reaching the customer, so a 1000% increase in drug prices across the board nets a 1-2% or less increase in costs for the customer and it lets them get away with increasing the cost steadily by ludicrous amounts with people wondering why their bills are steadily growing and they are taking loans out just to reach their deductibles.  
I do though believe single payer is the way to go because it's the only way to ensure that health care is a right to all citizens. When you compromise at every turn you get what happened with the ACA where it just was more of a raw deal for the bulk of people but it was very good at getting more people technically ensured.

"I would first be interested to learn about the varied opinions of the mod team on this issue, as my lack of experience with subreddit moderation and reddit's tools prevents me from describing a concrete plan.

That being said, what I had in mind was starting by gauging the interest of community members who would be willing to make short guides/videos/content specifically tailored to /r/summonerschool, with the assurance of their content receiving heavy exposure on the subreddit.  One way to implement this would be to have sticky threads where highly-upvoted requests for guides on a certain mechanic/strategic aspect would be featured in a future video.

"It's not really an opportunity, it's a lack of excuses for the LL. LL's can spend vast amounts of energy coming up with the Wheel of Excuses, the subterfuges and all the little games they plan in order to refuse without revealing their true selves.

Next time there is a missed opportunity, use it to have The Fight (not The Talk) and make them acknowledge the ugly truth. Make them say it. It's not because of Reasons, the Wheel of Excuses is BS. Force them them to acknowledge what's going on. 

It may be the only honest communication you'll ever have with an LL when it comes to this.

Is it really necessary to have every transaction (me buying an ice cream) settled on the public blockchain? Definitely not!

My cash transactions aren't registered anywhere, only when I withdraw cash from an ATM...

"Well it'd be nice since it's a useful (for rogue) 2-drop which currently doesn't really exist. 

DEFINITELY not autoinclude. 

And silent knight you can use to trade. Cutpurse would be a big tempo loss but enables combos later etc. which is IMO a fair tradeoff, you have to really milk that coin later with clever combos/play to get the tempo back. 

A big problem with rogue early game, you don't have a 1 drop, you don't have a 2 drop, you can coin SI on 2 but if you don't have coin you don't even have a good play on turn 3 unless you get the SI backstab dream 2 card combo.

"Using a cognito-aesthetically displeasing number is  the accepted best practice when including a unique number in a unique selling proposition, and of course, as we've all seen - price. 

if we see 666 or 1000 in a price, we think that the number is more arbitrary than we would if it was an uglier number, which we would assess as being the more real value, maybe even running a little subconscious process where we think that they must take the cost and add on a standard markup.

"Registered nurse. 3 day work week means I can work Sun/Mon/Tue one week, then Thu/Fri/Sat the next, to have an 8-day weekend without taking any PTO. Some hospitals don't require that you work 3 days each week, you only need 12 days scheduled for every 4-week period. Here in socal nurses could start at ~$90,000, and in norcal you could start at ~$130,000. If you want exact numbers, the wages for nurses at hospitals associated with the UC system are publicly available in appendix A of the [UC nursing union contract](http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/bargaining-units/nx/contract.html).

"It has so many flaws from a productive pro-sumer view when using it as a Desktop OS. All the fiddling around once you have to go beyond installing something from the application library. Compatibility issues with new hardware. Failures in UX design. And so on.

Linux as a server OS is great though. An absolute bliss to work with. The only gripe there would be that SMB is shitty in an Windows environment. But as a web-server, NAS etc., it is excellent.

"This diet was made to eliminate the need to track calories and macros, so I don't think you will find anything from the book or from Tim on what he recommends. 

If you eat only SCD approved meals you shouldn't need to count anything. If you're hungry have another meal, if not, proceed as usual until you are hungry. 

If you would like to know what the average you are eating is, track your meals with an app to see what the average ends up being for you. 

But keep in mind that the macros will change as you go. A person eating their first or second week on the SCD will likely eat way more carbs and just mass in general compared to someone who's been trucking for a while on the diet. 

Your needs change and so does your appetite. This is normal as hormone receptors for leptin (hormone which controls appetite) start working again.

It's fine to track stuff to follow progress and to have the data, but I would follow your appetite and energy levels to determine how much to eat.  ",1100.0

Gesproken en geschreven taal is jarenlang geëvolueerd tot wat het nu is, echter heeft men rond 1950 verzonnen dat die evolutie moest stoppen en het vanaf toen ineens zo moest. Het gevolg is dat men nog steeds jaarlijks discussiërt over dingen als: schrijf je kado of cadeau.

"The question is: Did the FBI identify the body/bones as Teresa Halbach?  According to what Amberlea found; the FBI found no DNA on the bones.  So they did not test DNA on the bones and therefore they didn't match Teresa with the bones.

The State (Sherry Colhane) found DNA on the bones with a partial match using Mytochondrial DNA which matched Teresa and her mother

So why pretend the FBI Identified Teresa?  And why did the FBI allow itself to be the source of the identification?  This isn't a trivial question.

All we've got for the ID of the body is a State Lab technician who is able to find DNA where the FBI cannot. Matching the blood from the RAV4 is not nearly the same as identifying the bones.  It's missing person vs. murder.

There is a huge problem if that body/bones cannot be identified.

With a Golem, POx2, and Faceless, you get 24 damage out for 10 mana. With Life Tap, it's not a hard combo to draw into, or at least enough to make the kill.",1252.195812

I would be more concerned about the long term consequences of that view if it weren't for demographics. I think Trump is the death throes of the current Republican Party, and I see no reason to compromise with a dying ideology. (I mean, literally, we bury millions of Republicans every year and very few new ones are coming of age.) I say stay the course and let nature do its work.

Both [iOS with Interface Builder](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/) and [Android with Layouts](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html) also use XML-based UI layout. As does [Mozilla with XUL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL).

"@Diesel-66 and @rnelsonee - Yep.  Perhaps picking car-selling practices as good example was a really bad choice.  :-)

@Golmaia - Good thought.  The contract was on an electronic register at the Verizon Store where my son signed.  You are correct, I should have read the fine print.  Half of the fees that eventually showed up on my bill are listed there.  Here's link to the [contract wording of fees](https://www.evernote.com/l/AQe58vRz-vVF4Ya67Rg6WA5SmgtP2ZuIHEA).  Given that my son signed (and we both should have read)  this on the cash register before signing, there's half the difference between $69.55/mo that the pre-sales rep promised and the $79(ish)/mo it'll likely be with all of the additional fees and surcharges.

Money. they make money by giving accurate ratings. If they don't give accurate ratings it devalues their product.

I don't group all Muslims as violent barbarians, but I truly believe Islam is NOT a religion of peace in its current state. 

In the current state that Islam is in now, the Quran is seen as the literal word of God and Muhammad is given a semi-divine, infallible status. Thus, when Islamic fundamentalists act violent, they're literally just doing what's written in the Quran or following Muhammad's example.

Islam needs to reform. Muhammad and the Qu'ran need to be open to interpretation and criticism, just like Christianity today. 

For example, in the middle ages, Christians used the story of Joshua and the Battle of Jericho to justify genocidal Holy War. They took the Bible too literally. Similarly, Muslims need to  accept the idea that Muhammad and the Qu'ran are open to interpretation and criticism and stop taking things so literally.",1100.0

"Pretty sure this wouldn't have been her uuvo; her uuvo would have been like Andromeda. Also, aside from Kirin there isn't really any evidence to suggest that gods with uuvos will get awoken evolutions anytime soon, and Kirin only happened because of the survey. If that's the case, then she wouldn't have gotten any stronger anyway, not until Gungho added more evolutions past uuvos and awokens (and she would have been far down the road even then). It wouldn't make sense for gods with uuvos to get awokens later and for gods with awokens to not get anything, so she could still potentially become stronger. This awoken is nothing to scoff at - it's essentially Lucifer with a higher multiplier and much better active, though with fewer sub options, though a smaller HP/RCV multiplier would definitely hurt.

"**13**/14. I actually have some moderate facial recognition problems IRL, and that is the reason *why* I'm able to pass these tests, because I've learned to compensate by associating people with specific facial features. I passed this test solely on eyebrows and lip shapes. Eyebrows are particularly revealing because they help give shape and focus to the eyes, which are really how we recognize one another best - focusing on the eyes brings out the person's entire face. 

Everyone in my life remembers who I am, but I have no idea who they are and it has always baffled me how people can 'know' me after only seeing me once. 

P.S. Oh yeah, and a moving, breathing, live face is so different from a static portrait that this test is not a good example of your facial recognition skills. A better test would include short .gifs or video clips of a person making several subtle expressions while turning here or there in a natural way (like looking up and then back down).",1100.0

"Good luck with that and all the best.  My wife and I tried for many years and were recommended for IVF.  However, we decided not to go that direction and pursued adoption instead.  Our boy is now 14 months old and playful and active as ever.

You'll probably feel emotions you've never felt before with the drugs and all that.  If it works, it works, if it doesn't, it doesn't, and that's OK.  Something you might want to consider, too, is the risk of multiples.  My wife and I discussed agreed to do a multi-fetal reduction if she became pregnant with more than two babies at the same time.  You should think of what to do in the event that you do become pregnant with more than two.  The health risks are huge for triplets on up.  Not to mention the extreme financial and emotional stresses it brings.

Hoping for the best!",1100.0

"Remember how i said to think of trade as an exchange of low skilled labour for high skilled labour (with Canada getting the high skilled labour). There is no real effect on jobs from trade (as in we will have the same number we started with). And how that benefits Canadians (since they get these higher skilled jobs with higher pay).

Now, lets throw some empirical evidence into the mix (that im sure you wont read anyways, but maybe im wrong).

[At the lower end of estimates there is no significant effect on wages](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/1993%20micro%202/1993b_bpeamicro_lawrence.PDF).

"I understand that people have individual preferences, but the speed with which some men will automatically dismiss a woman with short hair as unattractive is really surprising to me.  Like she could have a perfect body and killer face, but she has short hair, so she's un-dateable.  In some cases it's this almost aggressive dismissal of a woman because she chose not to define herself by how she measures up to the cultural standards of femininity.  I have this hunch that some men even resent women who have short hair because they're not playing the game according to the rules like they're supposed to (i.e. Try your best to look like Barbie so everyone will love you).  Women who disregard the ""rules"" of beauty seem to get punished for it, I find.

Whether you think it looks good or not, please don't pretend like the cinematography here is unique or that using muted colors is something ""new"". This has been extremely common in the industry for decades.

I haven't seen the movie, so I can't speak on the actual cinematography as of yet. But the colors? That's extremely common to the point of, basically, an industry trope at this point.

"Sometimes although not as much as when I was younger. I'm 6' tall, well spoken and generally people think I'm older. I don't think it has anything to do with looking ""old"", my skin looks great and I dress well (I actually get told I look like Taylor Swift a lot, especially by little girls) but I carry myself in a way that people assume I'm older. It's either that or the fact that my stature is imposing compared to most women. 

Overall though now that I'm 25 people guess my age correctly more than they ever did when I was younger. As a kid I always looked 2-3 years older than I was because I was so tall. My poor mom had a hard time with other parents giving her dirty looks when I was 3 acting like a 3 year old but looking like a 5 year old. As a middle schooler it was even worse because at 12 I looked like I was in high school. People don't expect to see a 5'8"" 12 year old. It was awful because I started getting hit on by significantly older guys long before I knew what how to handle it. ",1241.874254

The best time to do it is before you go to bed because it's preferable to not have stuff between your teeth while you sleep, but any time of day is better than not doing it at all. Just like the rest of your body, the skin repairs itself while you sleep, and products also penetrate the skin more at night, for this reason I think it's best to cleanse before bed. Of course, if the only time of day you can cleanse is earlier than that, then you do what you gotta do. As long as you aren't doing any kind of activities that would be getting your skin dirty in those hours before bed it's probably not an issue.",1268.324148

"When it comes to serotonin based drugs yes.  Absolutely.  This is why there is a lot of talk about 5-htp being a used to prime the body for MDxx.  Turns out, that the serotonin system is a slow system.  Which means, when you deplete it, it takes time to rebuild.

Things like MDxx and others basically ask the gland responsible for 5ht ( serotonin ) to either put more in the body, or to create a hybrid and release that.  The way meth works from what I have read, it doesn't ask, it tells that gland what to do, even after it's long depleted and running on reserves.

The problem comes from the fact that it takes weeks to fully recover.  This is why things like MDxx quit working after a few days, but you can do things like cocaine ( which work on the fast recover, dopamine system ) and get away with it everyday to get you high.

There used to be great slideshow online that talks about all of this in great detail, but I can't find it at all, but you are looking for the serotonin system.",1100.0

Do you know if the main spa areas and pool were co-ed?


Our other choice is the Onni Grove Park Inn. Did you look at that too? If so, can you tell me why you chose Biltmore Inn?

A native sister in my area is actually working with another group of JW natives to start up a rotation of public witnessing stands at powwows in my area and asked if I wanted to join. Anytime a native JW is found in the truth, they jump on it because it's a real bitch to preach to natives - and for good reason. We don't need more of this bullshit religion (Christianity in general) being forced on us. History is enough of a lesson for us.

Thankfully, I know they won't get far. They might have a bit more luck preaching to natives if they got one with them, but we're pretty good at shutting them out. Can't wait until I'm free myself and can do the same.

Honestly, the problem with your question is that its case dependent. There have been guys that have done 1 cycle and taken years to recover. On the other hand, there have been guys that have B&amp;C with no hCG and somehow still managed to have children. 

I'm not going to randomly make up odds for you to recover since it is so case dependent. I'd say if you run hCG, B&amp;C is actually better for you than running 3-4 cycles per year since by B&amp;C you keep more consistent hormonal levels which is overall better for your body and mental well being.

I use the approach of 2:1 blast to cruising ratio. You can base it off bloods though, if bloods are g2g you can blast. But, it is nice to give your body down time every once in awhile especially if you feel burnt out. No harm in cruising even if your bloods are good but you feel kinda burnt out and need a rest.

3. The suits next to actions are built in suits which can be used for triggers. When you have two suits required for a trigger then its usually one you've got built in and the other is required from the card flip (or you can stone for it if a master or henchman). There may be cases you require or can get suits in other ways (like Lenny giving out Rams to nearby models) but they'll usually tie in with one another.

I think the question for me is, are you going to spend that extra $250/month or save it once your car is paid off? Because if you pay off your car now you could reinvest that extra $250 and probably get a better return than sub 2%. If you end up spending it on other items, is there really a difference between paying $250/month on your car?

On another note, I would also be weary about compromising your security blanket (savings account) to pay off a loan with a very low APR.

Suggestions to improve: Save to TSP if you aren't already. This will free up well over $250/month so you can invest that extra money into your ROTH IRA.

I don't link MD as a cause of either, but just something that I have more of when my mental health issues get severe. It never really goes away with or without mental illness. I almost think of it as something separate.

"The swimsuits for all website had a live feed from instagram of people in their suits last year. I haven't been back over to look, but it was really helpful in picking a suit for a TV appearance I had w/ no time to reorder once I arrived.

Edit: And you'll note I've actually cited a variety of numbers. 4.5%, 2-8%, 6%, depending on the study in particular.

"I just want to say that although I can not vouch if it will work or not, that this method is actually honing the blade, not sharpening. Overtime your blade will get nicks and bends/dents on the edge that we can not see. Honing will straighten the edge and provide a cleaner slicing motion. Sharpening your blade is to remove some of the edge and get a narrower edge, this in turn actually weakens the blade and is more prone to dents and nicks. So don't use those gadgets that grind on the knife!

It should work with ceramic bowls as ceramic is typically harder than metal and allow you to hone the blade.",1245.55775
"Gordon did only play in 14 games that year and put up ridiculous numbers with Jason Campbell and Brandon Weeden as his QB's and he didn't have Brandon Marshall lining up across from him so teams could focus on Gordon yet he still put up monster numbers. His 2012 numbers weren't bad either for a rookie with a rookie Weeden and Colt McCoy as his QB's, his rookie numbers had a higher YPC than Jeffery has ever had. 

I don't think it's a stretch to say Gordon is better than Jeffery. I still would pick Jeffery, even if it meant paying slightly more for him. I trust Jeffery wont get suspended, Gordon is also a gamble in that you'll pay a guy who's only played 5 games in the past 2 seasons.",1100.0

"Four ways: 

1. People develop a deep interest in the field at university and pursue that line of work there. Because of that work and the networking that they create around it they eventually fall into an industry job. 
2. Somebody who starts out with a hobby interest in the field and develops deep skills on their own. Then because of their work and networking that they create around it they eventually fall into an industry job. 
3. They get an unrelated job in industry that also has those roles. Then, because of their work and networking that they create around it they eventually fall sideways into an industry job.

In a statement explaining his “no” vote on the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which set the military’s budget at $560 billion, Bernie expressed concern that “the military is unable to even account for how it spends all of its money.” Bernie also voted against the 2012 and 2013 defense authorization bills, voicing alarm at the size of the defense budget despite the United States having withdrawn all military members from Iraq at the end of 2011.

"I'm no political expert but I've been following the news for a long time and I can tell you one thing for sure. The page is turning in the favor of progressive countries in the region. Now that Iran and US have decided to focus more on future rather than on their ugly past, Iran is taking part in bringing stability back to the region (such as making this deal), hence it will receive more support and attention from west and east. While backward and extreme countries will lose support and significance eventually. 
In my opinion if it wasn't for the energy and ""security information"", west would have abandoned its support for these countries long before.

"I, too, am interested in anti-humanism but I haven't read much writing that is explicitly so. Stirner and Nietzsche are clearly anti-humanist without expressly declaring it; I would assume because they were aiming their analysis elsewhere. I did just stumble on this piece by Joff entitled [*The Possibility of an Anti-Humanist Anarchism*](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/joff-the-possibility-of-an-anti-humanist-anarchism) and it looks like there may be some decent thoughts in there. David Bohm's work could also be seen as supporting anti-humanism as he thinks there is no *essential* distinction between ""things"" and it is our language that creates this distinction/fragmentation/thing-hood. His book [Wholeness and the Implicate Order](http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/DavidBohm-WholenessAndTheImplicateOrder.pdf) is pretty tight.",1257.33556

Well my username originated as my dueling network username so my username gives me access to all yugioh cards I ever used in a deck. I could play a field spell that changes the environment and forces us both to abide by the rulers of the card game or if I have the powers of the yugioh anime characters then I make it a shadow game which also forces us to abide by the rules of the card game meaning you can only attack me directly if you defeat my monsters first. I would most likely opt for my exodia deck because my monsters probably wouldn't kill you so even if I won the game you'd just kill me afterwards so I need to use the only monster that could kill you. That deck IIRC had a 75% win rate but you could mostly likely annihilate all my monsters at once with one energy blast so I'd say me 6/10,1100.0

Make sure dnsmasq and iptables are installed

Connect ethernet cable between computers

"Start it on the orange middle temp setting and keep it on that until it seems like I'm no longer exhaling vapor. Probably around 15-20 mins.

Then I kick up the temp to the red highest setting. The first few drags are just as full as the first few drags on the middle temp setting. The taste diminishes but you're still getting vapor. Mixing the oven helps too.

I make a lil QWISO from my AVB I save after all is said and done. Over six months or so of saving AVB, I made about 1.5 G of wax which I'm still using so all in all, I love Pax.  

Edit: Or were you talking about how long do I go so long between cleanings? I actually prefer them a little used, as opposed to a freshly cleaned. It's my opinion that a clean downstem allows too much airflow, cooling the oven. Learning to inhale from the Pax is a lesson in itself.

" About point 2. It is not just F2Pool. Practically all Litecoin pools mine doge with exception of a few. 

 I don't think mining centralization is such a big of a problem. F2Pool would not destroy their business just to undermine us. Also it would undermine Litecoin. So practically they will commit suicide if they attack. 

 AuxPow was a great success for Dogecoin.

  You should also consider that F2Pool is not just 1 miner and they don't just mine 1 coin. Mining coins is their business. They have invested huge amounts of money in this and they have a vast interest to secure the coins they mine. 

 If you remember in the past people have worried that Ghash.io could attack Bitcoin, it never happened. Now Ghash.io are not a problem, because they are small. The problem of Bitcoin is not their miners or their security, their problem is a political one. 

 By the way, you can see here which pools merge mine Dogecoin (practically all of them):

"""Munattomia""? Onko sinusta parempi ettei miesten* luontaista aggressiivisuutta hillitä ja miehiä opeteta kontrolloimaan itseään? Kulttuurit missä impulssikontrollia ei arvosteta tuppaavat olevaan paljon väkivaltaisempia kuin ne missä se on arvokasta. Tällaisen ensimmäisiä kärsijöitä ovat yleensä toiset miehet, vaikka se tietysti näkyy myös seksuaalirikoksissa yms. 

Enkä siis mitenkään kannusta tukahduttamaan itseään, mutta itsekontrolli on hyvä taito osata. Pitää vaan olla kohtuus kaikessa.

"I've been getting spammed by these guys via linkedin and email for a couple months now saying they ""want to work with me.""  This is weird because:

* I don't work in indie games

* I haven't worked in indie games in the past

* I can't think of anything I could actually do for them as a company

So when someone is aggressively trying to get me to work for them despite the fact that they have no evidence that skills would benefit them, that means it's almost certainly scam.  Or at the very least it's a HR blitz so wide and generic that it's a complete waste of my time.

"Sony is ultimately to blame for mismanaging the property. Look at Star Wars. Harrison Ford hated that franchise *at least* as much as Bill Murray hates Ghostbusters II. Disney and Lucasfilm were well aware of that and gave the Han Solo character the rich and interesting dramatic conflict required to bring Ford to the table. (I honestly don't think he did it *just* as a cash grab, given how rich the man is and how much he really hated Return of the Jedi). Sony severely undervalued the Ghostbusters franchise and Bill Murray probably realised it. If they really wanted to get him on board, they could tried to bring in Wes Anderson to direct. I honestly don't think that'd have been any more risky to the franchise overall than Paul Feig. I actually think that Anderson's weird energy would be a really good choice for a Ghostbusters III, far better than Feig's brand of comedy since Bridesmaids.

Imo best fox for this could be how placement matches work. The way they work in SC2 is kinda bad. You just play 5 games and from those games you get a league no matter how good or bad you are playing.

For example in CS GO the system is pretty good. You must win 10 games and after that you will get your rank. This way MMR will go lower and lower until you start to win games and this way MMR won't stuck too high.

"For more info,  the 15 minutes teaching is general mechanics.  If you need to explain each factions powers and strategy it will go much longer.

"They mention it on the Quadrilogy DVD Making Of feature. After Horner only had a very short amount of time to come up with something for the music, he put a lot of it together in one night, especially the most famous cue which is when the Queen gets blasted out the airlock. Gale Anne Hurd then mentions that it then became a staple of action movies throughout the 1980's and that the music cue is used for a lot of trailers.

Talking about the lack of time:

"I've found Ash is best worked in my shop. You should just give to me.

Seriously though I think it's a very underrated species. Ash is my go-to ""light"" colored wood. Personally I think it looks a lot nicer than maple - especially finished. It works extremely similar to white oak - which is to say borderline pain in the ass. It's not too bad with machines, but the interlocked stuff sucks to hand plane, and it's almost always interlocked.

This is actually very significant because, while W's mostly considered good for its use as damage mitigation in fights, it can be an extremely strong fast-healing tool if used right.

Things you can face-tank to full heal Galio:

* Minion waves (walk ahead of the minion wave and press W while your own minion wave catches up)
* Traps (vs. Cait, Nidalee, Teemo; just self-cast W and take the plunge)  
* Raptor camp (past a certain point in the game; just press W and draw aggro)  
* Inhibitor turrets (either when you dive, or when your jungler/tank support/Bronze ADC throws themselves in)  
* DoT abilities (this is what makes Galio an effective counter to DoT champions like Malzahar, Brand, and Teemo)

He'd go over specifics for each stage, each transformation of Stadium, ledge guards situations, low%, high%, everything. When someone didn't punish optimally he'd mention what they could've done to fix it or what they should have done instead. Don't get me wrong, Toph and Scar are great together and have casted some pretty hype sets and done wonders. I just prefer M2k's knowledge of the game and I feel that knew players and experienced players alike could learn something with M2k on the mic.

edit: M2k has also been in the community long enough that he also knows player's habits. How they like to recover, how they punish certain things, when they'll switch characters, what stages they'll ban and what stage they'll most likely go to next. All kinds of things.

"Not a doctor, but from what I've been looking at, anxiety uses the nervous system. Knowing that, it can present itself in many different physical forms. Your body only has so many ways to tell you something is wrong. 

Honestly, if the doc says you are alright. Most cases it is anxiety or over thinking. Don't stress about it, learn some CBT or take an antihistamine if you fear it's allergies so you won't get worked up about it. Plus an antihistamine will calm you down as well as to relieve some anxiety you might be having because it makes you sleepy. I hope this helps, and hang in there.  Anxiety can be a honest to god living nightmare if you let it take control of you. Easier said then done but don't worry about it. Maybe you should try seeing a therapist, if you feel it's becoming out of hand.  Forget about the stigma with mental health, you got to do what's best for you.

"&gt;  My argument is that the eskimo has no responsibility to follow the rules just because someone tells him about God and his rules. He has to believe god exists before the rules have authority to him.

I still don't see how this conflicts with anything I've said.  My ""insufficient"" answer was that it's not better to keep people in the dark about God and sin just so they are less culpable for their sins.  Rather, it's better they know about sin, so they can avoid it, even if it means they might be more culpable for their sins.

You're saying that's an insufficient answer because some of the people that are taught about God and sin will not believe it.  I disagree.  A person who doesn't believe in God or sin is no worse off knowing that other people believe in God or sin--they are essentially as culpable for committing sin as they were before learning of sin.  However, those who come to believe are in better position to avoid sin because they know know what to avoid.",1234.15096

  &gt;So what are the advantages of having seg-wit as a soft fork?
With my current understanding nodes/miners who have not upgraded will see transactions as spendable by everyone if implemented as soft-fork. This means that miners on older versions will accept any transactions spending seg-wit outputs, transactions considered invalid by the new clients so old version miners will lose money by orphaned blocks in the best case. In the worst case old version miners will have the longest chain and people lose seg-wit money.

&gt;Effectively any invalid transaction considered valid by old clients will cause a hard fork.

&gt;So is my understanding correct?

"Zero tolerance rules means that the victim of bullies will be punished just as much (if not more) than the actual bully. Get pushed and shoved and have your stuff stolen? Well, sucks to be you, because the school administration will also punish you.

In a practical sense, this means you've got nothing to lose and everything to gain from fighting back.

However if you follow the rules for what you're supposed to do, it creates this bizarre situation of learned helplessness. You have to take the abuse and if you try to defend yourself you get punished even more. Even if you don't defend yourself you get punished.

So the lesson to learn here is not the one schools think they're teaching. The lesson here is to take matters into your own hands and defend yourself. Yes, this means using force. Fight back, protect yourself against bullies.

On top of that, the U.S customer service base is barely set up so working with them appears to be somewhat frustrating. I will probably buy a Gemini once the design flaw is fixed and the customer service becomes better. Now I've owned the 940 for a while, and I have very few bad things to say about it. Everything is perfect asides from the primary and secondary bevels being a little funky. Benchmade themselves have a great warranty/customer service program. You can also get the 940-1 and the knifeworks exclusive 940. I would also recommend anything by Spyderco/ZT as all of their knives that I've owned have been very nice.",1267.071926

Fun fact: as many horrified law enforcement agents will tell you, child porn is the fastest-growing ""niche"" out there.

There hasn't been a surge of men born with an innate sexual desire for kids, they've simply trained themselves to get off on it. This is the same reason why mainstream porn has taken a turn for the violent and creepy in general.

None of the proposed topics of conversation are so early that talking about them ahead of time is inappropriate.

Kids male and female will see gender stereotypes before they're even in first grade, let alone sixth grade.

They'll likely encounter issues of gender identity and sexuality before seventh grade. Even in the south.

I'd also hope that kids have had a talk about safe sex before tenth grade. Fifteen is a little late to be having your first conversation with your kids about contraception.

Parents should be having conversations with their kids about all this stuff way before these grades.

The concern here is that a teacher might say something the parents don't agree with. Something like women being equal to men or that God doesn't hate fags and maybe you shouldn't either or even that abortion is a complicated issue and not something you should bomb a clinic over.

Had a couple beers, saw some great golf (the difference between a top web.com player and a pga tour player is very small, and pretty much all putting), pretty cheap admission, no complaints. One year was super hot, wish I'd brought a chair to chill in the shade. The other year was very mild and I was happy to walk the course and follow a group around.

I used a golf gps app on my phone to get some distances and hole overviews as I was walking. That helped me understand how far they were hitting the ball and what type of plan they had for each hole.

In the case of solar and batteries, that process is probably a learning curve -- making more solar panels and batteries helps manufacturers discover how to make them ever more efficiently. ""

I could be on a telecon with clients or in a meeting with the CEO and Ill find my fingers gravitating towards that undershirt seam to play with it, twist it between my fingers etc.  Kinda like that nerd girl on SNL who would stick her hands under her armpits and then smell them... its kinda gross, but ... nnnnggggggghhhhh.",1300.0
"There is no controversy, they just use the wrong date. Back in 19th century when millenarianism appeared and various groups worked out their last days prophecies, little was known about ancient history and so quite arbitrary and different dates were proposed for ""the fall of Jerusalem"". When excavations started to happen, especially from 1920s onwards, too much interest was vested in 607 (actually, then 606, because they were quite illiterate math-wise and hadn't noticed that there was no ""year 0"") by Watchtower and so it becomes that though it is well known today that Jerusalem fell in 587BCE, WTS is not willing to admit it.

It's just like the USSR never admitted that they annexed the Baltic states and kept up their version of voluntary association. By definition, when there are clear objective evidence but one party refuses to acknowledge them, it is not controversy.

"Whenever you see a bible passage quoted and it makes no sense, it is probably a translation from the 17th century (KJV).

If you just google the passage with a newer translation like NIV or ESV, you'll get something like [this](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+12%3A5-6&amp;version=ESV;NIV) or [this](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+12%3A5-6&amp;version=ESV), which should be more readable.

"1968 försökte tjeckerna vara lite mindre kommunistiska och ha en socialistisk regering med lite demokrati och ett usn frihet. Det kallades Pragvåren (dels för att det var på våren, men också för att det antydde en demokratisering i Östblocket). Sovjet satte stopp för det med stridsvagnar.

Den regim som Sovjet tillsatte i Prag var väldigt hård mot allt som kunde antydas vara oppositionellt.

Unless you need the heavy pro body of the D3, you can get into a much more capable D750 with grip for about the same price.

Edit: Just checked and, yes, Rod Stewart mentioned medical issues preventing Bowie from going on tour on May 13, 2013. ""Howard asked Rod if he's going to go out with the new album and tour. Rod said of course he will. Howard said he figured that some people assume that they're going to sell albums based on their name but that just isn't true. He said that you still have to go out and tour. Howard said Bowie didn't go out and tour. Rod said that there might be medical reasons for that. Howard and Robin asked if that's true.

"the hardest part of it is that your hands are used for pads + leads and the left foot is used for basslines, like a foot organ.

On a standard piano, you would have to use some hand for the bassline if you're playing a style that requires it.

This is like saying if you played row row row your boat in time and correctly, you'd hear a perfect orchestra of percussion behind you because it is programmed to trigger based on where you are in the song.

Of course, the only functional difference between that and just having a backing track that you're playing along with is that it will either quantize your melody to the percussion, or sway the tempo with you.

if played perfectly, there would be no difference between the two set ups to an audience.",1100.0

"&gt; Windows server licensing has been pretty easy for awhile. At least since 2008R2. Before they had more tiers, but even then you got virtualization rights and it was pretty straightforward (I think 2 for standard, and 4 for enterprise or something, Datacenter was the same).

Depends on your rep, size, VLA, etcetera. I have had to deal with some seriously screwed up agreements. Since I'm primarily a midrange guy, I have to presume the rep or VAR isn't screwing me over. And I don't trust VARs. Usually screwing up on that level is reserved for anything Tivoli though.

I mean someone who have for example +8 in perception can roll a 18 and add the 8 and it would mean he got 28. While someone else can roll a 20 but have only +2 in perceptions which put him at 22.

Then there's always the camp factor, I feel like him and Whedon could certainly pull off something on the level of a Moore era picture, and the otherwise somewhat sophomoric sensuality he seems to like to include.

Idk, maybe pre-2007 Michael Bay but I feel like we would see a fairly CGI-heavy stock action movie with a bunch of gratuitous sexuality that would feel sleazy for a Bond film.

The TL:DR is that the ratio of debt to GDP is what matters, not just how much debt you have, and by that measure, the US is doing a lot better off then most developed countries. So in other words, we're fine. We can actually take on a lot more debt if we want to, as long as we are using that money to grow our economy proportionally along with the debt. 

The US also has quite low taxes compared to most other developed countries. I haven't seen any good reasons why we can't raise taxes on the rich and expand our debt as a way to grow our economy, rebuild our infrastructure, and make the economy fairer.

"I was threading a piece of 6.5"" OD pipe at work, and went to test the threads with the ring we put on, and count the spins until it falls off. The ring itself is a pretty hefty piece of metal probably weighing in a 4 or 5 lbs. Anyway, I had put the ring on all the way and began to take it off while keeping track of the spins. Usually for 6"" pipe you want 5-7 spins, and I was at like 4.5 when the ring popped off of the end. My kneejerk reaction was to try and catch it with my pinky as I do when I *expect* it to fall off, but I stuck my pinky in too late and the ring slammed my finger in between itself and the pieced of freshly cut/threaded pipe. 

It bled a shit ton, took like 2 weeks to heal up well enough to not dress the cut and hurt like a bitch. Needless to say I just let the ring drop now. Don't even bother trying to catch it. At least I learned my lesson!",1274.38228

"I have 2 Xbox Ones which I and 3 of my kids ages 7 to 15 use daily for some background.
-EA Access is worth the $30 a year. Xbox Live free with gold games are fun too. To get the free Xbox 360 Games with backwards compatibility you have to go through live online then they will be available on your Xbox One. Kind of a pain, but sure Microsoft will fix soon. 
-If something is not working correctly on the Xbox One. Game not loading, controller not syncing, sound error. Try restarting the system by restarting it through power menu or unplugging it for 60 seconds. This solves 99% problems. Also quitting the game on the home screen solves problems 50% of the time. 
-Get a larger USB 3.0 external desktop hard drive. I recommend one that plugs into the wall not portable style. I have a 3TB and 4TB Seagate I picked up at Costco for less than $120 each. These work great. I have around 80 games on each drive and they are not half full.
-Enjoy your new Xbox. ",1279.41498

"Wrong, humans are not ""mostly irrational"", they simply have limited information and differing preferences. 

Game theory is a way of analyzing a certain class of problems. You can get whatever conclusion you want out of it depending on how you model the problem and the people. Nobody who uses game theory believes that pure mathematical game theory is predictive of real life.

Actual intelligent people (i.e. not ill-informed, arrogant contrarians like yourself) know this stuff. An example in practice is the military's notion of something called OODA loops, which is essentially game theory (trying to anticipate enemy reactions to an unfolding situation, through the lens of all kinds of things including their culture and even genetics).",1272.84278

"A smoothbore gun, interesting. I know why gun development turned to rifling (old smoothbore guns were inaccurate due to the Magnus effect fucking the ball-shaped ammunition in flight, the spin imparted by rifling counters the Magnus effect and increases the effective range of the projectile, along with its effective kinetic energy and thus power), but I've always wondered why modern AT guns (especially on MBTs) transitioned back to smoothbore. Does it have something to do with the use of the Kinetic Penetrator ammo used these days?

And if they did add a 13 105, I wonder how they would translate. Would they ""unhistorical"" it and keep it smoothbore (what kind of ammo? APCR, HE?), or would they make it rifled like other 105s?",1100.0

"While I am not an expert there are several ways to make ""smart"" guns for safety.  One idea is to have a remote lock on the trigger where only the user can unlock it to fire.  Think of those keyless ignitions for cars and the key must be nearby to use.  Pro is that if the gun is stolen it is as useful as a brick, con is that if the user loses the key it is as useful as a brick.

Along the same line some really expensive smart guns offer biometric readers.  Same principle where only the owner can shoot. Bio metrics can be slow to read the user and unlock, which would be really bad in a self defence situation. Pro no key, con cost and usability

Lastly there is much simpler methods usually involving literally locking the trigger. Pro the gun can not be used until unlocked, con the owner must remember",1270.5639

"I don't think there are many Chinese immigrants in Europe, or I have at least never heard of any significant immigration movement.

For the other ones, yes, there are many insular communities of immigrants in different European countries, such as those from ex-Yugoslavia in Switzerland. And as I stated above, such semi-parallel societies are by and large considered to be failures, the result of unsuccessful integration.

&gt; And why haven't proposed cultural indoctrination reforms been proposed for those communities?

"&gt; I'd say f/1.4 is as fast as ""regular"" lenses go for aps-c and ff.

Ok and I'd say f/2.2-2.5 is ""regular"" lenses as far as medium format goes. Most are f/2.8 or f/4.

If you want to point to a medium format lens that is f/1.9, I can point to f/1.2, f/1.0, f/0.95, and f/0.7 135 format lenses.

Medium format lenses are bigger, heavier, and cost more. But if you went to f/1.4 or f/1.2 on medium format they'd be even bigger, even heavier, and cost even more... marketing says no one wants them enough to mass produce at a profitable price point.

The logical trajectory looking back at the history of photography is not for medium format to have a resurgence, but rather for companies to make more professional APS-C lenses.

I'd rather see Fuji spend their time and energy making f/0.7mm lenses for their APS-C line than making a 645 format camera. (now if they were working on a 6x7 or 6x9 format sensor, you'd might get me interested).",1250.282574

"Okay I think from the instructions you are doing the ten stitch blanket, there is a good video tutorial by verypink knits [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXMP2sd3yWk). 

But in essence, slipping a stitch purlwise is essentially moving the stitch from one needle to the other without working it as if you were going to purl.

In this pattern turn literally does mean turn your work to knit the next row, but the wrapping your next stitch means to not knit the next stitch, slip it from one needle to the other with your yarn in front, then turn, (your yarn should still be in front when you turn here) and slip the stitch back and then put the yarn in the back, then you can knit back again as normal.

One blow of the Valerian’s ponderous mace would shatter helmet and skull, and all would be over— once more the Delgonians would have triumphed. But the stubborn Dutchman, although at the very verge of surrender, was still fighting. One step forward he would take, bludgeon poised aloft, only to throw it convulsively backward. Then in spite of himself, he would go over and pick it up, again to step toward his crawling chief.

Again and again VanBuskirk repeated his futile performance while the Lensman struggled nearer and nearer the door. Finally he reached it and kicked it shut. Instantly the mental turmoil ceased and the two white and shaking Patrolmen released the limp, unconscious Velantian from his bonds.",1300.0
"I think what I'm going to do is adjust my workout so that I'm not bulking the thighs and hamstrings. What I want to do is tighten my butt in the hopes that it'll lift the fat I still have under it. I'm doing some crazy intense hip thrusts (floor work) for that. Will try to recomp my lower half by de-emphasizing the legs and improving the butt/hips. I don't know. I gotta research this and make sure I'm working things I should be working and laying off some stuff. I've always had big legs, and that's the only thing I would say I didn't prefer on my body right now. 

I'm jazzed about my waist, abs, everything upper body, actually. And I'm just so happy I can fit in a size 6 (US) pair of pants considering my leg issue. Truly astounding that I find myself here after wearing a size 18 when I started this. 

Hope you're doing well at the gym! Good luck with your ""puffy and weird""! Have to admit that made me chuckle. So funny how we see our bodies, isn't it?

"Santa Monica has established guidelines for compensation that must be paid tenants in the case the owner wants to exercise their right to an Ellis Act eviction, and begin living in the property herself. You can use the Santa Monica permanent relocation fees as a floor for your negotiation. After buying you out, your landlord will be able to renovate and re-rent the property for much higher rents, so they will enjoy a much higher return than if they simply lived in the property, as would be required after an Ellis eviction. So you should be able to negotiate significantly more than what's below.

[Here is a link to the guidelines](https://www.smgov.net/Departments/HED/Housing_and_Redevelopment/Housing/Fee_-_Tenant_Relocation/Fee_-_Tenant_Relocation.aspx), the values are below:



Housing Unit Type | 2015 Relocation Fee | Fee If Household Includes Senior/Disabled/Minor

*The banner on the playback control is changing to a native ad because the banner webview is often what causes crashes. It is a bit larger but that screen has so much free space it doesn't really matter. The ads should also be a lot more pleasant to look at.

"Works are not the cause of one's justification—that is, one's being counted righteous by God—but it's not as though good works aren't necessary. It's not as though I can have faith in Jesus, thereby being counted righteous, and then sin as much as I want. Paul responds to that objection in Romans 6. The same faith that causes my justification necessarily also gives rise to good works. That's how these ideas are typically reconciled—and it's not like we're imposing the reconciliation on the text, since Paul does seem to say something resembling this in Romans 6.

That being said, Matthew and Paul may very well disagree about a lot, including the nature of good works in one's justification. Matthew certainly wouldn't have agreed with Paul abandoning the dietary restrictions of Torah, since when Matthew copied Mark 7:19 in Matthew 15:10-20, he removed the parenthetical remark, ""thus he [Jesus] declared all foods clean"" found in Mark.",1251.70982

The knowledge of all of the unfinished tasks that need to be done will stress you out and make your depression worse. Being productive, even if it's only keeping your environment clean and body groomed, will make you feel ten times better and in control. 

The next time you sit in bed for hours, when you finally get up you should turn around and make your bed before doing anything else. Now you've already accomplished something, no matter how late you started your day.

"&gt; So, perhaps 'best' is in the eye of the beholder?

I can get behind that. But since the the word ""best"" is used as a comparison to the rest, then you must still be familiar with the rest in order to identify the best.

So you can love strawberry ice-cream and your friend can love vanilla; but neither of you can claim your preferred flavor as ""the best flavor"" (even subjectively) unless you've each tried the other flavors. Once you've both tried all the flavors, then your friend can proclaim vanilla is ""the best"" while you maintain strawberry is ""the best"".

At this point, however, you should note that I am purely arguing semantics, and not reddiquette. You should not let semantics decide your posting habits.

"I'm tracking racing weight. I started paying attention to weight after putting on too much weight while sidelined last winter. 

I was 116 in Nov. when I ran Philly, about 18%bf, which was ~ 9lbs lighter than when I ran my last PR. I got up to 120 post holidays, and I'm back down to 118 now. My goal is to get down to 114 by Boston (~17%bf), and then try out 112 this fall to see how that feels. 108-112 is going to be my lower limit to stay healthy (female triad, etc etc).

"I'm actually remaking levels from Super Mario World. I have nearly all of Donut Plains and Vanilla Dome completed. If you're a fan of Mario World, you might enjoy playing them.

Remaking levels from SMW has given me a much greater idea of how the game and it's levels are structured, so I decided to take advantage of this by attempting to make levels that are sort of modeled after levels from Super Mario World. It takes me a while to create original levels, so I've only made 2 so far.

"The skill system just helped you feel a little more progression/growth with your character. For example if I have a 75 gun stat but a 15 energy weapon stat, I won't be using energy weapons because I'll suck. Everything pretty much is unlocked for you from the beginning in FO4, up to and including mini guns and power armor. I've done nothing to train myself with energy weapons but they are as easy/simple to use as any other gun. Not too long after you can find nukes. In New Vegas the gun skill would actually increase reload speed, decrease spread, increase damage, etc. In FO4 the perks are all basically variants of 'do _x_ more damage' like in Skyrim. There are some interesting ones but for the most part it doesn't justify removing the skill system.

"Ah, I guess I'm getting more 50:50, fun:competitive mileage out of unranked since I was Diamond in WoL, and Plat now - and most of the people I run into are gold-diamond. 

I assumed if unranked was matched up with ranked players you'd still hit diamond/masters people, but that might not be the case.

"Yeah, Volcarona is nigh-unstoppable once she gets set up.  The problem is getting her that way, or having a chance to bring her out safely before rocks coem out.

I would probably get rid of substitute.  Volcarona's not that bulky untill she gets a couple of quiver dances up, at which point defense is not really an issue.

I ran a pretty successful Volcarona set a couple years back with Psychic as my 3rd attacking move; it's helpful as a counter to figting types (which frequently come with Stone Edge), and to the occassional Mega-Venusaur.

"Im an American fiber tech.  I came over to Australia in 2010 and promptly landed a 457 visa.  During my three years there, on the cusp of applying for my new visa I switched jobs.  During this time was the big gillard/Rudd/Abbot switch.  457 sponsorship was made ridiculous by Abbot as soon as he took over and my best option at that point was to return home.

Really sucked because I loved living there and got along quite well.  I had established myself and it was extremely expensive to rerelocate myself back home.  I enjoyed splicing fiber for the Sydney area and I was the project manager responsible for the splicing for the early stages of amazon and apple in a large well known data center.  It was some of the best times of my life and I'll sorely miss it.

"I had same situation as you except I didn't fail precalc. But when I took calculus, I forgot a lot of precalc and struggled with it until Applications of Derivatives.

I can tell you right now going to office hours is an incredible help. If you have any questions, a professor can answer them right there. Another good tip is if your book has a student solutions manual, buy it or rent it. It shows how to do each problem step by step and wish I had that first semester (I do now in Calc 2). 

Make sure you continue to do homework and read ahead, and maybe try khan academy. It was rough for me at first too but as the semester went on, I was able to raise my grade up from a 66% to a 74% to a B.

I'm a CS major, so I'm expected to have a heavy math curriculum too.

"Studying law?

Toronto - Often considered the top law school in Canada, located in Canada's biggest city.  Very expensive for Canadian students.

McGill - Also one of the best law schools in Canada, in one of the best cities in Canada.  Quebec is a civil law area, so it's a bit different from the rest of the country - probably more like what you're used to - while other provinces deal with British-derived common law.  You might want to check on to what extent French is required.

Dalhousie - great law school, but it's in a smaller city. It has character and friendly people.

Simon Fraser - Vancouver's lovely, but I would go for UBC as the university of choice.

Ottawa - because it's in the capital city, I'd imagine this law school has a lot of unique government-focused courses.  Ottawa is also where our country's Supreme Court is located.  I think UoO has the biggest law school by number of students.

"Cooling 333 ml of water from 25C to 5C requires the removal of (4.2 kJ/(kgK)) * 1000 kg/m^3 * 0.333 L * (1 m^3 / 1000 L) * 20K = about 28 kJ. The heat of sublimation of CO2 at standard pressure is 572.2 kJ/kg.  So the energy from subliming about 49g of CO2 is enough to lower the temperature of the water.  If your container is well-insulated and the thermal mass of the can is negligible, then you can assume all the heat needed to sublime the CO2 comes from the water.

Nicolas Jaar makes incredibly trippy, emotional, atmospheric music; he'll incorporate crazy samples to create soundscapes that are reminiscent of nature's sonic intricacy, and then out of nowhere the drone and emotional weight of these soundscapes evolve and shape themselves into a beat, and evolve further from there into a mindblowing rhythmic climax.

"I'm not really too sure about the whole emotional abuse thing, I've been reading articles but my partner really doesn't hit that many of them, it's starting to make me think that I'm probably over-reacting and being an arse. 

But I can tell you that he often blames me for his issues and choices in life, he often tells me he resents me for moving up in my career ahead of him, whilst he's in a job he hates, but doesn't actually know what he wants to do with his life and is only in this job because he was unemployed for near 6 months. 

I'm often called an idiot and told I must live a 'happy world full of rainbows and unicorns' when I'm only trying to think positively about a bleak situation, and he'll put me down about that as much as he can. 

Although I can't really speak for anyone else, I've never been in this type of situation and I've never really read or spoken to anyone about it before today.  ",1300.0

"Just FYI, your parents will never stop calling you ""rebellious."" I left the church at age 52 after going on a mission, graduating from BYU, marrying in the temple, raising 4 kids as a SAHM, serving as Primary Pres for 5 yrs, husband in bishopric - and as far as my parents were concerned, I was still bad, the rebel, the heretic, the doubter. At a certain point I realized they could never see me as anything else. It was freeing. I could stop trying to prove my worth to the world. I am just fine the way I am and if my own parents can't see that, well, it's sad for them. I would never treat my own kids like that. What's wrong with them? Answer: the church, which made them withhold love from their own children while claiming the right to judge them - even when they have done nothing wrong.",1300.0

"Tokarev, makarovs start at 350$ online when you can find them. They might be more common in illinois, but I've never seen one for sale in a brick and mortar shop.  

As long as the gun is a legitimate gift and you don't carry it outside of your home, you're fine to own one.  But you do have to be 18. And you have to be 21 in most places to legally buy pistol ammo, or just bullshit a cashier who doesn't know any better. 

However, if he held onto it for you for a couple years, taking you out to shoot it here and there and then fully giving it to you on your 18th, that's not a problem.

"If she were that human she'd have left with Frank after seeing how she got his whole family killed over a film reel and a man she hardly knows.

edit: for that matter I hate Frank too because the way he acts makes no sense either. He is by turns angry with her, understanding, frustrated, and deeply in love, but these emotional beats bear no relation to what's actually happening with his character. It's this whole love triangle that's clearly meant to bring in tension but the way they act towards each other makes it seem like Juliana doesn't give a shit about Frank, then exposition and close ups tell us she does, then Frank gets angry about weird stuff and in the next scene is totally passive when Jules fucks his life up for the tenth time. And Joe is just kind of... there. I *think* they're trying to make him sympathetic because of the conventions of storytelling but he's just... a prick.

I don't remember if it does with the Pipe Rifle, but I slapped a suppressor and a reflex glow sight from another Pipe Pistol that I bought off Arturo onto a modded out marksman rifle with a drum mag I found off a Super Mutant.

"As far as I'm aware, they're functionally identical.  I went with the Maker Select, as I've been a monoprice customer for a number of years and have been very impressed by their customer service, and the quality of their products.

I got some very good prints right out of the box, from the g-code included on the SD card, and the sample filament.  There are a few upgrades that you'll probably want to print immediately to get things running even better (new layer cooling fan duct, feet to raise the printer slightly and make it easier to square up) but overall it's probably the best bang for your buck (either Wanhao or Monoprice) and at it's price, it leaves you part of your budget to pick up a couple of rolls of filament, and things like a borosilicate or PEI bed to print on.

It had taken off from Angaur Airfield, flying on a bombing mission against anti-aircraft installations on Koror, Palau Islands. Whilst over Koror, the B-24 was hit by anti-aircraft fire . The fuselage fell in a flat spiral until it crashed. 10 crew members were onboard. 9 were killed in the crash except the Navigator, 2nd Lt Wallace F. Kaufman. He was captured by the Japanese and executed. There was a myth surrounding this footage that it was an American bomb striking the wing of the plane. However, a cleaned up version of the film has been analysed and it shows that the wing is struck from below. So it was not friendly fire.""

"Go to church where His Word is preached correctly and the sacraments are properly administered. It is through these means that God has promised to create and strengthen faith and offers the forgiveness of sins.

If there isn't a church nearby, find the closest one from this list and ask the pastor for a suggestion for a good church nearby.

I would also suggest reading [Luther's Small Catachism](http://bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php). If you find yourself agreeing with everything it says, you are a Lutheran in every meaningful sense.

Taking the relatively new physics of living systems offered by Goldman is something else I'd also suggest.

Additionally, no matter what you should take computational physics. It's sorta asinine that it's only a requirement for the applied physics degree. No matter what, you're going to do some amount of computational work. You cannot avoid that. Don't try to.

Additionally, you should definitely become involved with the local SPS chapter. What's SPS you ask? The Society of Physics Students. They're on the second floor of Howey, room S203. When I was an undergrad, all of my best friends were in that group and we all had each other's back.",1100.0

"I think he meant that beating the #1 ranked team and the only undefeated team in the country was a more impressive win. USC losing to an unranked Arizona State later in the season than Alabama lost to #7 USC also played a huge factor.

Even by today's standards, Alabama would have probably been ranked higher than USC going into the Bowl season. The CFP committee might seed USC higher, but the BCS and AP would almost certainly rank Bama higher.

Rankings have always been driven by quality of loss, timing of loss and SOS and Alabama had a better resume by those standards. 

I have always found it odd how much the timing of a loss can factor into things. If 2 teams have a similar resume with 1 loss to similar teams, the team that lost earlier will almost always be favored.

Not that your point is invalid and a heads up record should probably carry some extra weight.",1100.0

You should probably allow for the possibility that you can fix the issue yourself. It very well could be caused by either:

1) one or more problem apps, specifically any that run as 24/7 background services as seen in Developer Options &gt; Running Services. Even some high profile apps have not updated to properly support Android 6 new features (such as user defined permissions) and can cause issues.

2) if you restored the device from another device, many have reported issues until they factory reset without doing so.

"Augmenting is the single biggest moneysink when gearing up. Prices vary a bit by the server but to get the gist: 14x Augment slot kit mk-8, about 40k a pop. 14x purple augment 85-110k a pop.Then installing the aforementioned: 14x 35k

so 14(40k+100k+35)~2,5mil for the lot and you're fully augmented.

Moving mods around costs a bunch. Little under 13k per item so you're realistically looking around 3~3,5 mil until you're fully set. How much you have to move them around depends a lot on your spec and whether you build them into legacy bound gear or not.

These calculations assume you don't augment the 204 stuff before you trade them in. And you don't need to if you level via PVP, you can afford full 208 set out of the gate.

**addendum** This cost may seem like lot but it really is not. You can get that much in two-three evenings if you want. Just doing heroics on full group (easily doable on unaugmented pvp gear) nets you north of 1mil an hour.",1269.43304

Well, I get to England, and just send her a friendly text

""Hey there! I've finally made it to the island- would you like to meet up some time?""

Her response: ""Nah""

I thought it was maybe just dry humor, but nope. I asked her flat out if she thought she'd ever like to do something together and I got ""I'd rather not.""

I follow that general format but have thrown in a few more booty-centric exercises as well.  I moved deadlifts to the beginning of the lower hypertrophy day (heavy squats and deads on one day was too much),  and added in heavy hip thrusts to my lower power day.  I also throw in split squats sometimes for extra quad gainz, and switch up the bicep/tricep exercises for variety.

Things that really helped me loose the weight and keep it off: 

1.  Drink nothing but water and green tea/(occasional black coffee and shot of apple cider vinegar)
2.  Yoga, walking, kickboxing, exercise..(get off your ass and do something for at least 30 minutes a day. Youtube Yoga videos saved my life) 
3.  Consume more protein, especially when you exercise.  
4.  It's okay to indulge once in a while.(You're still human, give yourself credit.)  
5.  Stay away from fast food in general.  

Shedding the weight really improved my energy and libido  dramatically as well.  Life sucks bad enough being a T1, don't cheat yourself any further.  You can do it!  It's all about creating a routine and sticking to it.  Hold yourself accountable and be strong!  :)

Torches are 6 mana investment (not 10 as Tony) into same 2 fireballs, which are cheaper than classic, which better combo with other cards, like classic fireball+torch+ice block on turn 10 for 12 damage combo and survive ability, also torches dont lose your tempo -  you remove something midgame with them and draw lategame, when needed to burst.

Gruppen som väljer att testa sig kommer naturligtvis ha en för högt tal med tanke på att man är mer belägen att testa sig om man inte tror att man är sitt barns far.

För en grupp som identifierade sig som att de var säkra på att sina barn var sina egna, ligger talet runt 1-3% i snitt. Många högre tal för studier i vissa länder, men 1-3% verkar vara det genomsnittliga.

"So when you pull the fuel filter, you are supposed to suck out all the fuel from the filter housing. Any water that may have been in the system will get trapped in the filter housing. Now when you pop in the new filter the housing is full of air. You can have a small gas can of diesel and pour that into the housing to displace the air but that will likely make a mess. You can start the car and it will die a few times. However that is not good for the high pressure fuel pump. Cycling the ignition will not purge the air as the pumps don't start until the engine cranks. The dealer hooks up the computer and cycles the lift and low pressure pump. At home this can be done with a VCDS. That is why I bought one. Just plug in and there is a diagnostics mode that runs the pump. This pulls in fuel from the tank and sends the air out the return line to the fuel tank. Without running the HP fuel pump.

Vår föräldraförsäkring, där båda föräldrar har samma rätt att dela på 480 dagars ledighet när de får barn, och vår väl utbyggda barnomsorg (där man kan välja mellan privata och kommunala alternativ) är bidragande till att Sverige är på 4:e plats i världen vad gäller jämställdhet, medan USA är på [20:e plats](http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/rankings/).",1300.0

"Heimer for 2 reasons. One he is not very popular and often overlooked so people tend to underestimate the amounts of damage he can do. And two his kit is basically designed to dish out trucks of damage regardless of what the player controlling him is doing. All he has to do is sit in range of his turrets.

As a top lane main i just basically accepted that more often than not when playing vs heimer reguardless of what i do in lane eventually a roamer or jungler will come donate heimer a free kill and realize that yea his turrets hurt.

I was excited to try it out too since I use 4P Firebirds instead of Sage's, and figured the extra fire damage would synergize well, but I couldn't figure out a way to fit Woh, Aether Walker, and Orb of Infinite Depth all into the same build in any reasonable fashion while still keeping all the requisite set bonuses.

""P.T. (short for Playable Teaser) is a first-person psychological survival horror video game directed by Hideo Kojima, developed by Kojima Productions under the pseudonym ""7780s Studio"", and published by Konami. Released for the PlayStation 4 on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. served as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, a cancelled installment in the Silent Hill series. In P.T., the player explores a looping corridor of a haunted house while experiencing supernatural events.

P.T. was met with a positive critical reception. It was praised for its horror and the execution of the looping corridor, but was criticized for its complicated puzzles. After the cancellation of Silent Hills, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and eliminated the ability to re-download the game, a decision that was later criticized.""",1100.0

"1. The point about his age is flawed. We know that Kvothe aged during his time in the fae and, for all intents and purposes, did so at the natural 'human' rate. He perceived a year, give or take, to have passed there, and during this year he experienced his beard growing for the first time, and it happened a couple of times. That means that he aged normally. His body developed just like it would in a ""real world"" year. If he had spent 58 years in the Fae, he would look like he was in his 70s, and it clearly is not the case. There are many theories about where the Waystone Inn is located and, considering the references and roads nearby, it's definitely not in the Fae.

2. We know that Kvothe is a good actor and all, but I seriously doubt he would have gone through all this, ""pretending"" to lose his power and strength to capture Haliax. What would be the point? He wouldn't be able to do anything to him anyway.",1235.50194

"Not an estate planner or lawyer, but my understanding is that the estate tax is paid upon death on the entire value of the estate, before it is distributed to heirs.  So the rate is constant, not dependent on who or how many are getting it.

It would only apply to estates going forward.  It really couldn't be applied retroactively since those estates are already gone, absorbed into the estates of the inheritors.  And it would only apply to estates worth more than $3.5M, and would only apply to the portion of the value that's over $3.5M.  So if the estate was worth $3.6M, then the estate would owe $50,000 if the tax rate was 50% ((3.6M - 3.5M) * 50%).  ",1100.0

"Kvinner har ingenting i militæret å gjøre annet enn logistikk/kontor stillinger. Selv generaler i amerikanske militæret mener dette og folk flest også ser det ut til. Hvis du som kvinne vil være i militæret bør du stiller på helt lik linje med mannlige soldater, bære like tungt, ha akkurat samme krav, bade naken om så er også videre. En annen ting er at så fort en kvinne kommer inn i et gruppehold vil hun ofte være med på å demolarisere og splitte opp gruppen. Dette høres jo kanskje diskriminerende ut, men er nå engang slik at fakta er fakta. Jeg tror den eneste grunnen til at vi har pushet for verneplikt for kvinner og at dem skal inn, er kun for å blidgjøre kvinnelige politikere og feminister. Ikke fordi man egentlig vil eller burde.

"Got a 2006 Mitsubishi evo with a rebuilt title (light damage to passenger side when it was newish) that was running really rough. Turns out it had dual 450 fuel pumps, 1650cc injectors, stainless steel everything lines (Brakes, fuel, steering, etc), upgraded rear end, upgraded transfer case, upgraded transmission, upgraded ECU, 272 cams and a built engine (pistons/rods/caps/bearings/bolts/fasteners).

Why was it running rough? The fuel pressure was turned up about 15lbs too high and the sparkplugs were two steps too cold along with running pump gas on an e85 tune. 2 hours later, the car runs perfect unless it gets too cold where it will overboost.  I will retune it this spring when I retune my Supra.

I say two hours- but in reality it was about 12 hours since prior to just doing the fuel pressure and plugs/tune, I tore the fuel system apart and removed the head thinking there was an issue with one of those. This is how I discovered the goodies.

"Plumbers had to frequently work with it, and I don't just mean lead solder. 

For a very long time, the most common kind of DWV plumbing in homes was hub cast iron pipe. This required plumbers to melt lead and work with the fumes from it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqJk_AWYdDw At about 8 minutes in you'll see what I'm commenting about. 

I did it back in the late 70s early 80s. Sometimes it would have to be done in tight spaces with your face close to it.

"I saw this study long ago. One thing I didn't  like about it, is that it doesnt factor in the gender expectations of beauty regiments. 

Women, wether this is natural or socially conditioned, make more of an effort to look good (even if the point is not to look good for other men, but its just for the happiness of oneself). And men don't.  Men typically don't  wear makeup to cover up acne and discoloration.  Men typically don't have go overkill on removing hair  (arms, legs, brows, etc). Men typically dont try to pick the shampoo, lotion, conditioner, etc best suited for their hair or skin type. Men typically don't  care about fashion and wear clothes that give the illusion of beauty (shaping body, accentuating a certain area, etc.).

"&gt;They're surprisingly accurate with even just 8bit floating points, so there's speed up there

You can reduce NNs that have been trained at higher precisions. That is just round all the weights to the nearest value you can represent. You can use even less than 8 bits I believe and it still works, because NN weights don't rely too much on weight precision.

However training networks with only 8 bits is less accurate, unless you use stochastic rounding. The problem is a lot of the small numbers round down to zero, and the sum of them becomes very inaccurate. Stochastic rounding fixes that, but I don't know if it's possible to implement it easily.

OP doesn't want to train the network on the robot so it should be fine, but it's just something to keep in mind.",1265.90448

"I've been in an esthetics program for the last few months so I don't know if this qualifies as money or time saving but a couple things I've learned in correlation to my acne prone, oily skin: 

Salycic acid over everything. Cleanse twice, once to remove surface oil, second to treat. This alone has helped my skin immensely. Exfoliate every three days, or less if you can. Exfoliating causes your skin to over-produce its natural oils which will only make your skin worse. Immediately apply a light moisturizer. Use a toner only after exfoliating. 

Absolutely steer clear of coconut oils and similar products if your skin is at all naturally oily or prone to blackheads/breakouts. I learned this the hard way. 

This may sound a bit basic but I've been at war with my skin my entire life so these things alone have been huge for me. ",1265.107632

But none of this actually matters. at all. you want to pay 60 bucks for a full game? YOU CAN. just wait until september. Don't want to wait? don't mind paying piecewise? only want to try a couple and might not be into the whole thing? buy then individually. 

Now, of course I'm not saying I'm going to go and pre-order this game as soon as its available again. I'm making no judgements to whether this game will be good or whether the content that will be released will be worth a full 60 dollar price tag.

"Sure. As you mentioned, when doing a basic straight air you want your shoulders to be in line (parallel) with the board. Until a rider has a bit more control of the upper and lower body riding open tends to make a rider turn slightly as they go off a jump. In the video the two riders are compensating for this, but it is a big reason why they are bit 'squirrelly' in the air. 

There are a few other minor things, like breaking at the waist. This is where you lean forward a bit. I suspect this is because they are working towards grabs. Rather than bringing the board up by bending the knees and sucking them into the chest, riders will reach down for the board. 

Edit: After a second watch. One of the riders is better at sucking up the knees. The other one, you really notice it on the boxes and off camber jumps.

All of these are pretty common things that with a bit more practice they will clean up easily.",1269.78687

"I started my CCW process last January when I sent in my request for an interview. 9 months later I had my interview. After that I got my livescan and finger printing done. I then waited for my conditional approval instead of spending the $300 or so it would cost me to do my CCW firearms course and having it go to waste. 

So just over a year after I asked for an interview, I had my final interview and was handed my CCW card. I'm so happy to have the privilege to protect myself and to level the playing field.

This must've been 5/6 years ago , my memories of this dream start when i was sitting in an island really close to mainland (like 30 meters) , where there was a huge luxury hotel , and i was for some reason browsing a laptop , searching about whales.

Then outta nowhere comes a big-ass whale and eats me (like that kid's story) , proceding to spit me on the mainland , where i learn that i must face a gang of criminals (why i have no idea) and get to the top floor of the Hotel in order to kill their boss , which i did after facing lots of bandits armed with nothing but matrix-like moves , slow motion and tons of acrobatic moves .

"1. Yes, I changed Brawl. You're right, saying it is an autoinclude was a mistake.

2. Same as Number 1

3. I put TG there because it enables a variety of strong, competitive decks. They may not be overpowered, but they are consistent and never leaves ladder. Priest, Warrior and Warlock are 3 classes that TG can be played in, maybe there will be even more dragon synergy in the future. 

4. I'm not sure about putting Doomsayer and Ice Block into the S-Tier as Freezemage will always be hardcountered by Control Warrior. New players should probably invest their dust in a safer deck.

5. I moved Murloc Warleader up.

6. Sorry, I don't follow Starladder. But from what I've seen in other tournaments, guides, streams and personal experience is that Enhanco is mostly a win-more card. He won't do much if you don't already have a strong board. Giving a bunch of 1/1 Imps taunt isn't that impactful.

"&gt; we now know that the Pacific Northwest has experienced forty-one subduction-zone earthquakes in the past ten thousand years. If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle.

Much of my family fell away (some remained christian some went full atheist) afterwards as well and no one has had a problem with the others changing their belief systems. All my old friends are still friends and it's all fine.

Pillars of Eternity is solid, but nothing special. If you like stuff like Baldurs Gate 2 you could go this route, but you will get a much ""safer"" story, less memorable characters and a generic bland world. 

Wasteland 2 is a game focused on exploration, combat, choices and consequences. It offers good writing but if you want a dialogue heavy game it is a bad choice.

Divinity: OS has a GREAT interactive world, awesome turn-based combat that feels like tabletop but a wacky world and mediocre writing that is not serious. Also it has co-op. It's a great game, I would rate it 9/10.  

Shadowrun is 3 games.

Предположим ситуацию, Крым остается в составе России, мост построен, энергомост построен, построена АЭС, в России прогресс, развитие и счастье. В таком случае с/х в Крыму не нужно абсолютно — продукты можно возить из Краснодарского края. Тяжелая промышленность тоже не нужна, она на материке. Крым делится на степную часть, где ничего нет, разве что заповедник и побережье, которое обеспечивается местной водой и опреснительными установками.

I can't find any information about the time from buttsex to having infected semen, so I can't get any further than this. 


An easier question to answer would be ""How many sexual contacts would it take to transmit HIV from the 8th person to the first person? ""

"I must admit that I am not even sure when the J started getting added to the RPG title, as even as far as the end of the PS2 era I had never encountered the term. I stopped gaming for about 2 years and when I got back to it I was already out of touch for calling FF an RPG. 

I suspect it was that online and print magazines in the west could make traditional narrative based RPGs like Final Fantasy distinct from the increasingly popular open world branch/MMOs in their reviews and marketing. This isn't unheard of in general, they drive a lot of the jargon for their own convenience, and at the time they had a lot more standing. 

I personally take it as a general thing and with a proverbial grain of salt. I know that 'W' just denotes Western style RPGs and the 'J' denotes Japanese style RPGs. I personally don't bother with them as terms personally because I come from a simpler time [if you ignore all the subgenre shenanigans].

Well, there are two small problems. The main veterans group that Trump has used for publicity stunts in the past, the Wounded Warrior Project, was the subject of a scathing CBS report about their spending practices. Besides, if Trump is planning on using them, he hasn’t told anyone from the group. Per CNN, the Wounded Warrior Project has not even been contacted by Trump about possibly doing an event tomorrow.

If he is doing it for some other group, they are now lining up to say that they don’t want any money Trump might make off of promoting himself, and will reject it if offered.

"I've had complaints against me for this very thing. 

I am polite always,  in words, tone, and demeaner. I even try to fake a smile when initially greeting a customer. But yet I have been told I was ""rude"" for not keeping a smile plastered on my face 24/7. 

I once had someone call the store and complain about me not smiling. It turned out to be a person who I didn't even interact with, they just happened to walk by me helping another customer, notice I wasn't smiling, take note of my name and complain about it. I stopped wearing my name badge after that. Nothing came of it formally, but I did get told that I should try to look more friendly and approachable by management. Fuck that. It hurts to try to fake smile all day.

tl;dr: If CGI actors become popular, they are going to be copies of past human actors.

I do not think CGI actors can actually replace normal humans actors initially. Acting is more than just spouting lines and whatnot. Subtle movements, different emphasis on different words, etc, make up what the viewers like about certain actors and their performances.

Simply *manufacturing* an actor with bullet points on what you think is popular is not going to work well.

Agreed with you 110% all the way until the *very* last point. I definitely think that, ""all the hints pointing to Rey being Luke's daughter"", is sound thinking- but I really believe that it is *equally* as possible that it is all misdirection. 

I think there is a lot of credence in the argument that it is almost *too* straight forward (e.g. 1,2,3,__). I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if they set that pattern up, only to reveal it all as a red herring later.

Moving their cannon fodder over to fight the Russians might have postponed the inevitable, but not by much.   At that point in the war they didn't have a nuclear program, they didn't have an effective air force, they didn't even have a viable industrial base.

The way I think it works in EU/EW is if you enter a tile in LOS and then try to exit that tile.

Take for instance the case where you just enter range. You've entered the enemies LOS but haven't tried to leave so you're OK. But if you were to try, they would take a shot at you which can be seen on numerous Beagle videos.

As to the one tile movement. Remember, you have to enter and then try to leave a tile in LOS. So a one tile movement will only enter, not try to leave and thus no reaction.",1270.76228

So I went back to my primary care physician and asked to be referred to another physician and explained why I did not want to see that physician. I asked for a new ortho referral and also a pain management referral so that I could have a care team. I have a physician who specializes all things pain and knows what is best and then I have another who specializes in me keeping movement in my limbs. ",1237.41994

He admits that in addition to a wage ceiling, he tries to reduce the difference between the lowest and highest earners:

“We don’t have a big gap ­between what our players earn at Arsenal,” said Wenger. “We are more a socialist model and vulnerable because of that.

Players received raises without merit, simply for squad morale and more equality. this is why the likes of denilson, diaby, squillaci, santos, arshavin, etc to earn £50k+/week. bloating the wage bill for no good reason. meanwhile our top players were being underpaid.

"The Vive cameras tend to be seen as HTC's bit of proprietary value-added to Valve's SteamVR platform (Norm seemed to be working on this assumption in [his latest Vive hands-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2WmDszPe5M), and the HTC guy seemed to indicate otherwise) but the latest work, at least, seems to be driven by Valve. Actually, it really looks like Valve is scratching its own itch here: on Twitter and elsewhere there's been lots of talk from Valve people about the difficulties of working together in a office with others when some of you are in VR, and the new camera/Chaperone system seems highly suited for that even in its relatively rough state. It's probably going to be a bit less valuable for most early VR consumers, though still useful.

"I have a Radeon 7850 video card and ever since I updated the drivers to afterburner the video card fans will stay quiet most of the time while gaming, but occasionally they spin up all of a sudden for about 10 seconds. I don't shut down the game, the noise just kind of stops on its own.

I have Speccy on my computer and it looks like the video card will get to about 65 celsius and stay around that point. It's just weird that the fan would suddenly get really loud for a little bit then quiet down while the game just runs like normal. These are relatively old games, by the way (Borderlands 2, Dawn of War 2).

Does this sound like there's a problem with the card? I said this started after updating the drivers, but the truth is it might have always been like this and I never noticed.

"""Libertarianism"" does not equal small government. Per Wikipedia:

&gt; Libertarianism (Latin: liber, ""free"") is a political philosophy that **upholds liberty and the non-aggression principle**[1] as its principal objectives. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association, and the primacy of individual judgment.[2][3] **Some libertarians advocate laissez-faire capitalism** and strong private property rights,[4] such as in land, infrastructure, and natural resources. **Others, notably libertarian socialists,[5] seek to abolish capitalism** and private ownership of the means of production in favor of their common or cooperative ownership and management.[6][7] An additional line of division is between minarchists and anarchists. While minarchists think that a minimal centralized government is necessary, anarchists propose to completely eliminate the state.[8][9]",1300.0

This is definitely the way I see it. When people talk about it being suppressed it can conjure up images of some evil rich bankers behind the scenes manipulating the price to whatever suits them. I think the price is far lower than it should be but that its just a result of how our entire system is set up and how the price of everything is based on speculators just trying to guess which direction the market will move so they can make a quick buck. Everything gets leveraged so far to allow them to make more money that it ends up barely even resembling the true market that its supposedly tied to. It's all just been turned into one big casino. Eventually its going to break and the average person who's not paying attention and didn't even realize they were playing along will get fleeced. ,1100.0

"I can't really compare CE with Original in terms of difficulty, because first time I played Original Xenonauts, it was Veteran with no Ironman.

What I like about X:CE the most is window vaulting and how fast aliens make their turn in ground combat, also I really like new interface in general. X:CE do not really rebalanced the game hard, but makes a lot of little tweaks or bug-fixes, that in turn makes whole game a bit different.

"My wife, son and I live in 16th St Heights, which is just north of Columbia Heights and west of Petworth. We absolutely love it. We've been in our house for a bit over four years now, and while prices have climbed quite a bit you should still be able to find something easily in your price range. It's a bit of a long walk to the Petworth metro - about 20 minutes - but buses run very frequently on 14th and 16th streets to downtown and up to Silver Spring. We walk over to restaurants on Upshur St. and Georgia Ave. regularly, including Petworth Citizen, CRane &amp; Turtle, Domku, Twisted Horn, The Pitch, Chez Billy (when we have a sitter), and soon to be including Slim's Diner, Timber Pizza Co. and the as-of-yet unnamed Thai and Latin restaurants opening on Upshur. At the same time we have a row house on a quiet street with almost no traffic and no problems parking. There's some property crime but violent crime is almost unheard of.",1263.29992

This seems like what I am looking for, however I now have 2 more questions.

That's very disappointing about your husband's family. I hope they will come around and stop acting like children.

"Clubs ranking according to their efficiency since the start of the season. The indicator of efficiency refers to the ability of teams to achieve the highest number of points with respect to their levels of grip on the game and dangerousness.


The indicator of the grip on the game refers to the number and location of passes achieved compared to opponents, while that of dangerousness is the ratio between the number and quality of shots attempted and conceded.


The average value between grip on the game and dangerousness results in a composite indicator which allows us measuring the level of dominance of teams and estimating in an objective way the number of points that a club should have obtained accordingly. The comparison between points estimated and achieved permits us highlighting the most and least efficient teams. Future will tell what is the part of luck for the most efficient teams and that of bad luck for the most inefficient ones.",1100.0

If anyone else is ever in this situation, where your car isn't hooked up yet and the tow driver looks like they won't stop, you want to record it on your phone, and you want to get in the car and start it ASAP.  If they still won't stop, move the car, even if it's just backing up in the spot a little, and leave it in gear and tell them to get out of the way.  You certainly don't want to hit anyone/thing (as much as you might think you want to, I hate the vultures in the town), but they won't be able to/won't want to risk hooking it up if there's a chance it'll move on them.  

They can't force you to leave the vehicle, and they can't legally touch the car if you're in it before they have it hooked up.  If they won't move, call the cops.  DO NOT get out of the car until the police show up.  Record everything.

"Oculus was bought by Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg agreed with Palmer Luckey's vision and wanted to make sure he had the funding necessary to carry it out. Even if Oculus bombs this release, VR is here to stay. 

Content also requires hardware. It's a chicken-egg problem. People won't make content if no one has the hardware. People won't buy hardware if there's no content. The way to break this cycle is by creating a VR experience that is both amazing and affordable. In order to break the cycle, Oculus completely funded about 30 games including Rockband VR and Eve Valkyrie. They are also selling at cost to make it affordable. 


Oculus is going to be first to market. Two or three years from now they'll be able to start getting their profits back. But even with CV2 release, they may decide to keep profits low to up adoption rates. VR and AR are the future, people don't know they need it yet. ",1274.69406

"I think pictures and a video would be useful here. While it's possible that the derailer is bent, it's not really the most likely outcome of a bike tipping over, especially if it didn't fall from a great height.

If the alignment of the gears, the rear derailer jockey wheel and the chain segment that runs between the jockey wheel and the gears is all parallel, I would say it's worth giving your gears a reindex and checking your cable tension - especially if the bike just tipped over rather than falling from a great height. Sometimes the limit screws can be knocked out of place.

If this doesn't work, or you don't fancy it, take it to the LBS. That being said I had a very similar problem after tipping over myself and got a lot of value out of learning how to do very basic gear maintenance like this. Allen keys, a screwdriver, a good eye, and YouTube should be all you need. If it is only shifting roughly then even if this procedure goes wrong, the problem won't be made much worse.",1100.0

However what they didn't account for was the fact that the last arena card is always rare or above so the perfectly teched Hemet counter deck lost out against the 10 mana deathwing counter that discards all the beasts in your hand so the filthy Hemet deck ended up not getting any value from them. ,1100.0

&gt;There are various types of exhumation that can be performed. There is exhumation proper of the corpse, symbolic exhumation and exhumation of bones that have previously been exhumed. The essential idea is to reveal the nfumbe and interact with him or her with the object of forming a contract. The nfumbe must be willing to be seated in a new body and to become part of your household. Defying this principle can lead to occurrences of _nfuri,_ the restless and malevolent dead, or simple failure. The contract takes the form of purchasing the soul of the nfumbe.

"In my current world, most of my civilizations are ported from real world. So I don't have to worry about this. 

In my previous tries, I tried to make a language by mixing Korean grammar with German pronounciation and creating a vocabulary from null by randomly throwing things and expanding them. But I found it too energy consuming to maintain the knowledge of a virtual language. So I abandoned the method. 

Now I'm satisfied by having vague ideas of how the languages are like in my world: If there is gender? How is the word order? How to pronounce? The similarities and differences between the language and the others in the world? Some fun facts/stories about it?

He was already all over my Facebook feed before he died, and now everyone acts like he's a god. Well, they already did, but now they're just more rabid about it. It happens any time an artist or entertainer dies.

If a celebrity dies, I don't care. Robin Williams was someone I grew up watching, yet when he died I saw him as just another celebrity that happened to die. Most of the people I knew who talked about him didn't actually watch most of his stuff beyond Aladdin or Hook.

It happens when regular people die, too. Someone could be a serial rapist and murderer, yet when they die, everyone they ever knew suddenly treats them as if they were a saint.",1255.0375

On roadway or roadways with 4 or more lanes, the driver approaching from the front shall not stop.

[Link to relevant law](http://delcode.delaware.gov/title21/c041/sc07/index.shtml) 

Should also note the penalty for breaking this law is quite severe, automatic license suspension, fine, and possibly 30-60 days jail for first offense. Second offense is MANDATORY 60 days to 6 months jail. ",1100.0

"Agreed. At first, both seem similar because they are third person, have similar movements, a down system, etc.

But to be honest, TD just looks like another TPS with a lot of ammo, and it takes quite a lot of bullets to take someone out.

TLOU on the other hand...it's brutal. You can't afford to miss your shots etc.

A game which is like TLOU is R6:Siege. Now that game is tactical as well. There is no health regen, so you are forced to be in cover. There is no way to get more ammo, ammo drains very quickly.

TLOU is like the innovated third person shooter that other games need to catch up to, and R6:S is the innovated first person shooter that others need to catch up to.",1251.34854

Wahhabi Islam is most certainly the ""parent"" ideology for these attacks. Many other movements were born out of this strain of thought including Salafism, which is the most prominent type of political and religious thought to come out of the 20th-21st century. Most of these attackers espoused to those religious beliefs.

There is/was increased funding for different types of schools in Pakistan by the Saudi government, many of those who were from this school would go on to become militants. However, the terrorists in this case belong to the Pakistani Taliban, who have been trying to overthrow the current Pakistani government for the past 10 years. The Pakistanis launched an offensive last year to eliminate this movement in Northwest Pakistan, which has largely forced the movement to go underground. Currently, they operate more as a criminal gang/terrorist group in poor urban areas moreso than as a militant group.",1100.0

I then learned to separate myself from the whole ""scene"" that I had meshed together. By that I mean I loved playing music, that's really what I cared about. All the party stuff was just a scene and I took myself out of that. Now I still play but it's a gig, I'm there to play music and when I'm done I leave. It's like a job (one which I love) but I don't involve myself in the scene. Two different things if that makes sense.

Another way to get multiple colors is to take a smaller amounts of frosting and color them, then kind of smear or ""paint"" them up the sides of the bag and then continue filling the bag how you normally would with the rest of the frosting.

He simply said that it is incredibly expensive to flood defence the whole country. Nothing wrong with that. It's an honest point to make. - 65 downvoted. What? What did he do wrong exactly other than open his mouth on a thread dominated by anti tory narrative?

I went into that thread and the only comment with -65 was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3zuk6b/tories_admit_they_scrapped_flood_defence_plans/cyp5nfg). He does *not* say that it's incredibly expensive to flood defence the whole country; he says it's cheaper to repair and recover from flood damage than ""defending everywhere it needs to"". I assume he was mass downvoted because comments underneath pointed out that this is untrue.

Now, -65 is probably quite a harsh score for the content of the comment, but it seems like you're deliberately misrepresenting comments to suit your theory",1100.0

"&gt;これは何かの冗談ですか? 
&gt;小学校「道徳教育」の驚きの実態

&gt;一例として、少し前からインターネット上で話題になっている道徳教材について検討してみよう。

&gt;読者の皆さんは、この教材を見てどう思うだろうか。シッカリトシタ学校教育を受けたリョウシキアル方々は、「人の失敗を許すのは大切だ。これを機にクラスの団結力を高めよう」と思うのかもしれない。

&gt;実際、この教材の解説にも、「相手を思いやる気持ちを持って、運動会の組体操を成功に導こう」という道徳目標が示されている。教材の実践報告にも、「この実践後の組体操の練習もさらに真剣に取り組み、練習中の雰囲気もとてもよいものになった」と誇らしげな記述がある。そこには、骨折という事故の重大さは、まるで語られていない。

&gt;なぜ、学校が舞台になると、「骨折ぐらいは仕方ない。お互いに許して団結しよう」という話になってしまうのだろうか。この教材を見た時、私は、「法とは何なのか」をあらためて真剣に考えなくてはならないと思った。

&gt;法的に見ると、つよし君が参加した組体操は、違法の可能性が高い。

首尾一貫して、「つよしくんを許す許さない」は異常な道徳教育の事例として挙げてる。",1100.0

"An ultimatum may make it easier for you - you'll have a conclusion - but you may not like the outcome.  That being said, you're not crazy, and you'll probably get really tired of this situation many times over.

But your parents' world (which they've held onto for longer than you've been alive) has been turned upside down.  They love you, of that I'm sure.  They just don't know how to interact with you.  What you're doing is wrong before God (in their eyes), and they don't want to condone it.  But they don't want to lose you.

In my walk, I've found that many Christians, myself included, have found security and peace when we've ""got it all figured out"", and right and wrong is as clear as black and white.  You've shaken things up and they're staring at a major contradiction in their hearts.  It's not unexpected that they'll contradict themselves as a symptom of the confusion they're trying to understand.

-third and final thing is I am still in savings for the computer only have about 750$ in the bank so it might be a week or two before I'm ready to buy and build and I just wanted to get a feel for things today. Should I buy things as I have the money and they might go on sale or just wait until I have it all upfront ? Also I might be running a Ethernet cable up to my room by then anyway.

It's amazing visiting different countries in the muslim world and seeing the different cultures. What is more unique is whatever country you go to we have this universal language of Islam that binds us together. I can say Salaam in Indonesia or Lebanon, people will reply back with Salaam. People do get fascinated with a muslim that has an American accent. I really wanna visit some of the west African muslim countries like Senegal or Gambia etc.

Québec: Il s'est entendu avec l'église Catholique pour leur donner le contrôle de l'éducation au Canada en échange de pousser le Québec dans la confédération. L'Église a fait de voter contre joindre la Canada un péché mortel et refusé d'entendre les confession de tout ceux qui votent contre (les votes n'étaient pas secret à l'époque). L'Église a tenu promesse.

Des propriétaires de terres mâles (les seuls personnes ayant un droit de vote à l'époque) 60% on choisi le Canada et 40% on choisi l'enfer.

Pour les maritimes, il a fait signer les dirigeant saoul (il avait apporté pour 3500$ de champagne, ce qui donne un quart de million si on transpose à notre époque). Quand ils ont dégrisé, ils étaient pas très joyeux et on formé le premier parti d’opposition : Le parti anti-confédération.",1100.0

"I am indeed from the US. I have a small child, though. I would have to pay a babysitter for overnights and would not be able to be present during the day if I am tired from working two jobs. My main reason for sticking with my current job is that I can stay home with my daughter, followed closely by being able to make art for a living. 

I have a Master's, and if I wanted to go back to more conventional employment I could, which I would probably do in lieu of working on my feet if I had to. I am hoping to find a solution that will avoid that and let me keep at my art job and home with my kiddo. It is always an option, and you have a good point. I just am really resistant to putting my kid in daycare.",1285.065008
"&gt; what you are proposing here

Just to clarify: I'm not ""proposing an engine"" in case that was the perception, there isn't enough of ""engine"" in the 9 blocks plus some piping, and it was well known for some time.

If I didn't think your engine was cool, I wouldn't have linked it in the first place.

I am however pointing out that as long as one is willing to give up fuel efficiency, there are much simpler and still viable alternatives. My main tool of DWG destruction is a hydrofoil with main body being 9x4x29. With a 200mm 180RPM main gun proudly occupying the middle 1/3 of the hull, the injected engine fits easily into what's left, E3200 wouldn't (even if I removed the turret --- the interior is 3m high in the thickest part).

&gt;i just hope you realize there are also good use cases for the E3200.

That would only be if I decided to add a rail to my 200mm, sorry :) Otherwise space in significantly shorter supply on my boat than fuel.",1100.0

2. translating the bitcode to a host-specific executable as soon as the module loads in the browser but before any code execution.

"So i made a website like 2 years ago. I linked my adsense there (which i had since the blogspot days) and i was ready to make a big breakthrough. Things were going fine for a month or two, then suddenly i get a ban from adsense without any explanation whatsoever. I tried to get back my account but there were just automated answers and no human to explain why i got banned etc. It fucked me up. An extremely small site at its first steps but it fucked me up and i still send mail to adsense to this day with the hope that i get a human answer that explains why.

I lost all interest and energy and now i just visit my site now and then to find an abandoned wreck.

Ubuntu will have no problem using the 3TB NTFS drive with your media on it. Try not to add anything to that drive and just delete / move things off there as you get to them. (That way you can eventually reformat it as EXT4, XFS, etc.) You can add that drive right into your plex libraries with no problems.

 Using the known official multipliers for the Ssj forms and the strength differences indicated in the manga and the Daizenshuu for Gotenks in comparison to Goku and Vegeta, Ssj3 Gotenks is anywhere between 8x to 100x as strong as Ssj3 Goku. Gohan, being even further above Ssj3 Gotenks, would then easily be many times over Ssj3 Goku in terms of power, even if you go by the most conservative route.",1100.0

"There are other places on the west coast that could be visited before we revisit any city. Unfortunately, the first two games covered basically all of California (hell, 2 may have made it up into Oregon). San Diego would be the only place in Cal left to visit, and Virgina City would be the only place left to go in Nevada.

Personally, I'm thinking either Texas, or we visit Arizona or Utah. The thing with the latter is that it would force there to be a cannon ending to NV (maybe, you could wing it and only decide it wasn't the Legion ending and the death of Caesar caused the dissolution of the Legion, a likely scenario).

That becomes obvious when you see how much Zoro improved by spending some time with Mihawk. There's no way he would have improved that much just by physically training like he always do.

Stopping physical training, on the other hand, can be pretty harmful. One can't just go to the gym for 10 years every single day and then suddenly become a sedentary. It literally kills you.

No. That's red. Sure looks grey to me. Concensus has to be right though huh? Also. You should be able to tell why an obtuse angle is beautiful. I didn't ask for its color. I asked why is that make up of lines beautiful. Why is that angle beautiful. Or why isn't it.

"I'd recommend you try [Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30296/Rakudai_Kishi_no_Cavalry).

At the start of the anime the MC is not considered to be strong, on the contrary he's considered to be the absolute weakest of all. During a tournament where people have to fight it out we see the MC dominate everyone he fights, and it's explained why he's considered to be the weakest person around.

Throughout the series we see him earn the respect of his peers as well as some people ranked higher than him. One point of the series is that the MC wants to earn the respect of *someone* above him and doesn't understand why he can't actually do that.

I really enjoyed the series, and once you've watched a couple of episodes you get to see just how strong the MC really is :)",1100.0

"Rules Reference Pg. 7:

&gt; **Duplicates**

&gt; A player may use additional copies, by title, of any unique card he or she owns and controls in play as duplicates. When a card enters play as a duplicate, it is placed faceup, overlapped by the copy of the card that was already in play.

&gt; ...

&gt; Duplicates have **no text, titles, characteristics, type, or traits**. A duplicate is only considered a blank ""duplicate card' while it is in play.


Since a duplicate has no type, it cannot be a character and would not be affected or counted by any card ability that specifies the character (or any other) card type.",1285.5210299999999
"&gt; For quite a few people a ""decent"" lifestyle is actually quite opulent.

Anecdotally, this is often the case among my peers. They complain -- justifiably -- about expensive housing, paying off student debt, the wage stagnation compared to inflation, etc, but then they talk about how their haircut costs $150-200, or how they want the latest iPhone, or that the vet costs for their pets' checkups are so high, or that they can't wait to go on their Caribbean cruise.

Does it suck to refrain from spending money on personal interests? Absolutely. But it's definitely not impossible to save up for important things like housing and family needs. An average couple would have a household income of $80,000-100,000, that means they could afford a downpayment on a house in about five years.",1250.752246

"Tldr :

&gt; To prevent a worst-case scenario—technological change accompanied by talent shortages, mass unemployment and growing inequality—reskilling and upskilling of today’s workers will be critical. While much has been said about the need for reform in basic education, it is simply not possible to weather the current technological revolution by waiting for the next generation’s workforce to become better prepared. Instead it is critical that businesses take an active role in supporting their current workforces through re-training, that individuals take a proactive approach to their own lifelong learning and that governments create the enabling environment, rapidly and creatively, to assist these efforts. In particular, business collaboration within industries to create larger pools of skilled talent will become indispensable, as will multi-sector skilling partnerships that leverage the very same collaborative models that underpin many of the technology-driven business changes underway today.",1282.76892

"Here's my recent pickup, a vintage 1980 Tudor Submariner Date (*9411/0) in black with its trademark ""Snowflake"" hands. These used a modified 2784 ETA movement.

I've been searching for one of these all year - they've become rather hard to find now.

Most of the early 60-70's examples (7016 &amp;amp;amp; 7021) I saw had dial rot, replaced hands, and service inserts.

Later examples from the 80's (9401 and 9411) were in a bit better condition, but still difficult to find in great condition.

Tudors were worn hard so that explains their limited availability in the market. 

If you're searching for one, I recommend researching and educating yourself on the references and examine each potential piece in person.

"It's pretty easy to understand. The applicant pool is oversaturated. I mean, 50,000 applicants for 20,000 spots? It is a buyers market, and the schools can afford to select based on higher quantifiers. When you have 10K applicants applying to one school with 200 spots, and 5K of the applicants are qualified, why wouldn't you choose the highest standards?

Now, what consists of the ""highest standards "" is a little up for debate, and that relates to the process you are questioning.

The Blazers are 9th in the west and I expect the Kings, Pelicans and Timberwolves are all going to play better in the second half of the season, though the kings could implode. We'll probably keep the pick. I think trading some players and rocking the boat would do more harm than good, if we do ""try"" to miss the playoffs it will be by sitting players with mild injuries. 

Tanking is harder than you think. Portland still has NBA talent and has not-Byron Scott at coach, we'll never be able to tank with the Sixers and Lakers.  The GM may want the team to loose, but every other person in the organization, the coaches, trainers, assistants, scouts, players, wives and fans want them to win every game they play. Every home game you have 20k people who want to win, every time you're on national TV you want to make an impression, there are 6 rotation players who don't have contracts next year, they're playing their asses off.

In all likelihood the distribution is slightly different, with fewer people spending heavily and more people with $20-$30/mo spending, but in general you could probably approximate the population this way.

Now look at the report. KDB estimates 2Wbn revenue from the quarter, which is $1.657M/qtr. In other words, KDB is providing a fairly generous estimate for what people are spending in game. They aren't providing an unrealistic analysis for the sake of being contrary.",1100.0

"The SuperFly 4 uses Unlocked Zoom I think, not Lunarlon, and I'm 99% sure the SF3 uses the same. They definitely aren't Lunarlon. The cushion feels really soft, and the insole is similarly quite comfortable and squishy. I believe it's basically the same cushion setup as the Jordan XX8 and XX9, except for the insoles which feel notably different (SF3 is softer). If your brace is comfortable with the Jordan XX9, that'll probably give you the best support of all the likely options you have. I'm not sure if you'll find the cushion soft enough in terms of standing feel, although it is extremely comfortable and makes landings feel nice and soft, but you can try them on basically anywhere to find out. I've heard nothing but good things about the XX9 Lows, so the mids or lows are both good options, if a little pricey.",1100.0

"First off: You will not want to play on an official server, even with a professional tribe of 20 people you will end up in rage and all time lost.  
  
It is not difficult to group up at all, Ark makes it easy to group and find each other.  Within a few hours of gametime you can build a bed and then spawn in your base.  
When choosing a server you'll need to avoid all official servers and then try to find one without cheating admin :-)  
Also look for a server that's not up for several months, you'll not be able to catch up anymore.  

i don't know where you are from, I play on a 3 week old  PVP server hosted in EU which is very nice.   
Took me maybe 200 ingame hours to find that one ;)

I live in Glencoe and Im pretty sure that the gardens are in Glencoe, thus in Cook County. The border between Lake and Cook is right on lake cook road, and the gardens are south of the road (the front entrance is on the south edge of the road)

Another thing. Glencoe and the botanic gardens are actually closer to Chicago than to Wisconsin. Glencoe to Chicago is about 12 miles, and the distance from Glencoe to Wisconsin is about 29 miles.

Jews and Muslims both worship the Creator of the Universe, so if the Universe has multiple creators, where are the boundary lines between the parts that theirs created and the parts that ours did?  (I hope I'm living in a part that ours created.)  Did they have some sort of committee meeting to agree on the physical laws?  Because those don't seem to change as you move between different Creators' zones.

"Yea I did quitting smoking six times. I'd eat heaps after quitting then I'd start smoking again so after six times I ended up fat (+15kg) and still smoking. In Oct 2014 I quit for good and started losing the weight in mid Jan 15 (lost 20kg) and now I'm back to normal. No one ever said anything to me about my weight gain so I didn't notice until I found a scale as I've always liked my body and then when I realised I was 4kg away from being obese I freaked out about diabetes and started calorie counting. I wish it was not taboo to point out weight gain in society given the long term effects of it as it might have made me realise earlier. It's infuriating to me that society seems to be moving towards accepting obesity. To me, it's just as bad as tolerating drug addiction, smoking or alcoholism. 

It was not hard to lose the weight other than being hungry for a month at the start. Now I feel awesome and will stick to watching my Calories, weight lifting and weighing myself once a week so it never happens again. ",1270.977246

"This is painting a deceptively rosy picture. ""VERY good reason"" is stretched rather a lot.

Off the top of my head:

No charges laid after police FINISH OFF a mentally ill man who is CRAWLING on the ground after already being shot... his weapon? A BICYCLE CHAIN.

&gt;A Vancouver police officer who was involved in a fatal shooting that was captured on a cellphone video won’t face charges because he could reasonably argue self-defence, a special prosecutor announced Monday...

&gt;Chipperfield had told a coroner’s inquest he believed Boyd was armed with a bicycle chain when he fired the fatal shot. He also said he believed Boyd may have been wearing body armour because it appeared as though he wasn’t affected by the initial shots.

&gt;But the shaky video showed Boyd crawling along the ground, no longer holding the chain, in the seconds before the ninth and final shot.

"Essentially, the truth of the matter is that Vintage and Legacy is the game *as the players of the time period perceived it*. It may or may not have been how Richard Garfield intended the game to work, and it certainly isn't how Wizards of the Coast now views the game in terms of design.

The fact of the matter is that, even if the reserved list was abolished tomorrow, Wizards would not want to print powerful dual lands like the original duals, nor would they want artifact mana like the moxen. Frankly (and this is coming from someone who *loves* both Vintage and Legacy far more than any other format and owns power), a lot of the fun of modern magic is that restrictive design breeds creativity. Moxen aren't interesting, nor is Ancestral Recall - they are just so powerful that it is fun to sometimes play with those spells despite their game-breaking nature.

"I agree that it is statistically unlikely for newbs to be consistently matched with elite players. However when it is does happen it results in the newbs being annihilated which is very off-putting for some players.

In any case the larger problem with CBMM is that it is statistically likely that newbs will be consistently matched with players better than them. Sometimes it will be by a little and sometimes it will be by a huge amount but there will almost always be someone significantly better than a below-average player, especially in 6v6 modes. Essentially with CBMM every game is a sweat for below-average players and you obviously know now that feels.

How would you feel about much broader SBMM that just kept the top third of players away from the bottom third? The middle third would be available to play with everyone.

I questioned what definition of maturity would lead someone to think that punishing people for using a naughty word. The admins said 'Mature people don't swear'. I fired back that mature people aren't bothered by some PG13 words, and he banned me for ""disrespect"".

That sure taught me a lesson about maturity.

It makes the machine take like ten minutes to make a cup and it still comes out weak, which is weird.  Seems to work okay for my GF's ground Starbucks or whatever she buys.

We've had a few different reusable cups too.  I like the steel ones better than the plastic ones, which ended up losing gaskets and having the tops snap off, etc.  The steel ones seem to be easier to clean, too.  They empty right out with a little tap with a spoon on the bottom.

"Balls was very solid on this game with hai controlling his engages- both of his riskiest plays turned out well. 

Jensen is very, very good at TF. Like God-tier this game, nearly solo killed froggen on freaking anivia 3 times. 

Sneaky looks very comfortable with hai in his lane, he made a questionable attempt at top t2 turret but was otherwise very safe

Hai's shot calling was Jesus-mode and his mechanical skill was strong

Rush had all of his mechanical skill in play and all of hai's control to keep him from throwing. He was a nightmare to deal with even without his favorite hard carry junglers to help him. 

Lemon did very well in picks/bans, with the slightly better-than-EF team comp that put half the team on comfort picks to give a powerful advantage. ",1100.0

That is just gibberish.

&gt;Aiming is about keeping the CoF on target. 

You do realise they go hand in hand, right? Maybe not, so I'll spell it out: when you 'aim', if your COF has 'gone' (i.e. you've mag dumped too much), you will not hit the target. It's exactly the same principle as stepping in the VR and hip fire mag dumping at a stationary target near you, watching everything miss.

* Buying cheap consumables and selling higher when player packs are out. I don't have a problem with this either it's actually a good coin making strategy. It isn't cornering the market it's just playing the market almost like you would play stocks. Buy low and sell high.

Same goes for assigning editors. Also, the editors might feel they can do better on a certain season if they have watched some of the shows or like certain shows or even if they have a preference over the theme/pacing, so their input should be taken into account as well before anything is assigned.

"The question is unreasonable because it's painfully vague. 

Why have health insurance? Because it's reasonable to expect something will happen and eventually you will want to persue medical treatment.

Why have car insurance? Because it's reasonable to expect something will happen and eventually you will need mechanic assistance.

Why have a weapon? Because it's reasonable to desire protection against the unlikely. Because even though there is a statistically low likelihood of violence, the mortality of that low possibility is high enough to cause alarm.

Now, to answer your question in a way that will get me down voted to hell:

Any job where you work in a public setting and have to provide services to people where you may have to say ""no"" could put you on a proverbial shit list. Because of that I want to know I can protect myself should that statistically low likelihood of violence come to fruition.

"When I was in fourth or fifth grade I used to walk home from school. It was very close, about a block and a half away so wasn't too sketchy and it was a safe neighborhood. I was walking with a friend when a Jeep Wrangler came driving up, the kind with no top or anything so you could hang out if it, and these older kids were in the car. They were at least Jr high level and had a super soaker that they aimed at my friend and I and shot. That day I happened to be carrying a pretty thick text book and held it up to shield myself from the spray. They shot one quick shot and immediately drove off. When I looked at my book there was a pancake sized hole in the cover and my friend got scared and ran home while I was just shocked.

""According to the survey, a majority of likely voters among Democrats (75%), Independents (64%) and Republicans (54%) see the wave of spending by Super PACs this election cycle as “wrong and leads to our elected officials representing the views of wealthy donors.” So far in the 2014 election cycle, Super PACs, which can raise unlimited sums from donors, have spent $87.5 million and counting to influence election outcomes. Though Republicans view Super PACs significantly more favorably than do Democrats, both sides benefit from the influx of cash to the tune of $43.4 million for conservatives and $41.9 million for liberals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.""

I wouldn't be so sure about that. My cholesterol numbers haven't been very stable.

そいつがまた気持ちの悪い声を発しながら私の足の人差し指に触れた瞬間(ソレはぬめぬめとしていて、チクチクとしていて、生ぬるく不快だった)、思いっきり蹴飛ばした。

This  research  also  indicates  a  large health cost  savings from raising tobacco taxes (US$2.55 billion over the  lifetime  of the current  population), even  when  accounting  for  the  extra  costs  from  the  longer  lifespan  of  ex-smokers.

"Lol, the comments are entertaining...
&gt; Keith Walker -  November 29, 2015 - 1:26 am  
&gt; In the late 1950’s, a verbose variation on the term “I couldn’t care less” was spoken, “I suppose I could care less, but I don’t see how.” Words were dropped out over the next few years until “I could care less” was all that was left. Those too young to know the history of the saying likely cringe and think it is nonsense. Those who know its derivation mentally hear the unspoken words and accept its meaning without concern.
&gt; &gt; Oedipus -  December 24, 2016 - 5:31 am  
&gt; &gt; That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying the popular Theban saying of “I could bang my mom, if I didn’t know she was my mom” changed over time to the popular West Virginian saying of “I could bang my mom.” They actually mean two very different things.",1100.0

"Thanks for the in depth response!

I see your logic behind choosing all SF/PF (swiss army knives). However, just last night my roommate did that exact thing - LeBron, KD, AD, Kawhi - and I jumped him by bringing out Shaq. He had no answer for him on the inside and Shaq got 11 rebounds. This leads me to believe that there's a better team build for blacktop, at least in 2k16.

Furthermore, one of us usually always picks Curry. While he's a liabilty on defense, he gets steals, and more importantly he's knockdown from the 3pt when open. Since 3's in blacktop are worth 2x as many points (compared to a normal game when theyre only worth 1.5x as many points), I think that the 3pointer in this thread is being severely underestimated.

My normal strategy is indeed to run the pick and roll and dish to the help side for the 3 pointer, but he's gotten too damn good and defending the pick n roll now",1100.0

"Very true.  The FAs state that the ""war on obesity"" is a war on ""obese"" people because fat people can not separate themselves from their fat as it is a part of their body.  They are hated for the body they have, and it is a radical and brave act to exist in a fat body in a fat-hating world that wants to eradicate and make you disappear.  

Therefore to eradicate fatness is promoting eliminationist and violent rhetoric and practices against fat people.  That is why the leaders in the FA movement are strongly against anything and anyone that engages in, supports or encourages weightloss for weightloss sake.  Even if it is a person losing weight to improve their own health--they are seen as a traitor and actively harming fat people and the FA Movement.  Unless you succeed at losing weight (via surgery), and call yourself a survivor-- then you can be the head of NAAFA.

2. It's going to be really really really hard to disarm ember in a team fight BEFORE he gets his first sleight off. If you disarm him after sleight, it's not useful since the duration will expire before the next one, if you save it long enough for the next sleight, it's 5s into a team fight and you're whole team is dead(you too)

That's not what I meant but I can see why you'd be quick to jump to that counterargument.  I'm simply stating that we all have choices when planning our lives.  Some of us are blessed to have more options than others but we all still can control our lives to a pretty large degree.  So having kids and then complaining about having less money is just one particular choice.  For some its worth it. Others not.  But its still a choice and a the circumstance is decided by the individual in charge.,1300.0

I guess I would reword that a bit, and look at the question from a different perspective.  What if God is offering us an opportunity to go along with him while he blesses someone, be it financial, friendship, understanding, etc?  We often hear ""You are an answer to prayer"" when we fill a need for someone else. If we decline that opportunity, he'll find another person and give him/her a chance to share the blessing.

If you can't set the TCR directly, it increases in resistance approximately 3/4 as fast as nickel does. You need to deduct room temperature from your preferred vaping temperature, multiply by 0.75 and add room temperature to the result.

"&gt; and I'm not sure why

I believe the main reason is that it would muddy the ownership story, unlike the existing ""Deref coercion"" from `&amp;T` to `&amp;U` where the data is already borrowed. The [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0241-deref-conversions.md) that introduced the latter includes [a little discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0241-deref-conversions.md#alternatives) of a similar (but not exactly the same) conversion.

In any case, allowing a coercion from `T` to `&amp;T` isn't enough for coercing things ""deeply"", like the arguments of a function type: they need to have the same in-memory representation for that to work, and `T` and `&amp;T` are very different (this includes Deref coercions and every other coercion except for `&amp;'a T` ↔ `&amp;'b T`).

The goal for the heroes is to kill these Little soldiers, which grant you gold to purchase a variety of items, armor and weapons. These Little soldiers spawn and run to each of these so called lanes. To win the game you have to kill the enemies ""Nexus"". The Nexus is their ""heart"" or ""source of power"" (don't know what to call it). To get to this ""Nexus"" you need to destroy some turrets which are guarding their base. In each lane you have 3 turrets + 2 defending the ""Nexus""

Don't know if this makes sense at all but I find people seem to understand when I explain it this way ",1268.77466

"Är visserligen inte journalister som har makten. Förtal är ett brott enligt 5 kap. 1 § BrB (samt någon paragraf i TF jag inte kan komma ihåg).

Det är sant att det är upp till journalister att bestämma när de vill publicera något, men de styrs av straffbestämmelserna (om de inte brinner för att bryta mot lagen). Förtalreglerna är ytterst restriktiva när det kommer till personer som det anses vara av samhällsintresse att folket får hålla koll på.

Vilket är anledningen till att man får trycka skapligt mycket mer klandervärda uppgifter om statsministern än om sin granne.

Sen får man väl tycka vad man vill om det, men att säga att journalisterna styr är lite fel, med tanke på att de endast följer lagen.

Vill du klaga på detta är det väl snarare politikerna du ska kritisera än journalisterna.",1100.0

Und im Ort, wo der Prozess abgehalten wird, wird jeder Anwohner einer erhöhten Terrorgefahr ausgesetzt. Und wofür das ganze? Ein Freispruch wird wohl nicht dabei rauskommen, eher die Todesstrafe (in den USA. Oder verklagen wir ihn nach deutschem Recht, so dass er in 15 Jahren bei guter Führung wieder rauskommt?). Also Bin Laden dann noch 20 Jahre in die Todeszelle sperren und jedes Jahr Entführungen und Morde haben, um ihn freizupressen, bevor man ihn tötet. Oder wir sprechen ihn frei, weil die Navy Seals vergessen haben, ihm seine Miranda-Rechte vorzulesen oder es keine ""Beweise"", also keinen schriftlichen, notarisch beglaubigten Befehl für die Angriffe des 9.11. mit Bin Ladens Unterschrift und Stempel gibt.

"most sets are trashed after movie shoots - there is just no way to store them, and they are not built to last. Each of the original movies had a full size Falcon built, or at least part of it. In fact for Jedi, they didn't even use the shot in the final cut. http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/battle-in-the-desert/ 

And of course the inside is a separate set. The exterior Falcon set is mostly scaffolding:

Speaking of which, here are a few key pics showing the partial construction of large sets. Using set extension with a matte painting (glass or digital) is an essential part of filmmaking, and should never be poo-pooed as CGI. JarJar is CGI, digitally or optically extending a set is the only practical way to work.

"As someone once told me, you have to find that thing you're passionate about and good at and pursue it. 

I grew up in a household where everybody worked in some way or another in the legal field. I was five when I saw my late grandfather, a lawyer, argue his case in front of a judge.
